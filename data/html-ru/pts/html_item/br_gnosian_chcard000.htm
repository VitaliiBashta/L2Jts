<br> <br> <font color="LEVEL">Side Chapter #3</font> <br><br>There was nothing. No traces of the Elf even after searching through every corner of the site.<br><br>I am Gnosian. I have been looking for something special for years. My search has taken me to each of Aden's corners, and now has brought me here, to these Elven relics. It has been said that there was a secret technology possessed by Marilion, queen of the Elves, that had for centuries been hidden away here. This magical device, which could allegedly wipe out a whole city in an instant and poison its lands for 100 years stirred fear... terror even... in the magical Elves....<br><br>According to the rumors, it is a device that can wipe out a whole city in an instant and poison its lands for 100 years. What on earth is this thing? I came to find it, uncover it, and bring it back to the world.<br><br>Fortunately, my search has not been carried out alone. I've found an apprentice of sorts, a human child named Iken. I am the first Elf he has seen, yet still he treats me with the upmost respect and courtesy. A fitting companion, I suppose. He's dedicated and hard-working, determined to master the sword even in his young years.<br><br>One day I was searching through the second basement level when I felt something immense near specific parts of the relics. I am quite certain other Elves would have missed it: their senses are not as atuned as mine, and this loud buzz would have been little more than faint, distant hum to them. I uncovered the source of this power; it was a small machine which granted me passage deeper into the basement.<br><br>I decided to go there by myself. Iken would have thanked me; this was no place for children. No place for anyone, actually. There were traps everywhere, traps which I was barely able to avoid as I continued my descent. How many stairs had I come down? If our world had a core, I must have reached it, but still gravity pulled my down, my legs willing but exhausted subjects to the steps' endless path. I walked and walked until the light from the basement had dimmed, dimmed further, then slipped away entirely. Agathion's lantern then sparked into life, and I continued down further, deeper into the darkness.<br><br>By the time I felt that I was too tired to go on any longer after, as my legs had finished screaming in agony and had simply buckled under my own meagre weight, something new struck my senses. It was the salty smell of sea water, but here? I carried on and, driven by curiosity, found a huge cave filled with sea water. A bridge lay before me, offering me a pathway to the center of the cave.<br><br>At the center of this colossal cavern lay a huge red stone, big as an adult Elf. It resonated with incredible power, capturing and entrancing me with its ethereal glow. All around lay Elven texts, some explaining our great history, some theorizing on the nature of time and space in the ancient Elven language, but that stone... incredible.<br><br>"Skreak...skreak!"<br><br>It came from the top of the tower. I looked up to find hundreds... maybe thousands of Harpies calling each other... waking each other.<br><br>I could not fight them all; their numbers were too great and though my powers were substantial, my exhaustion had dulled me greatly. Fortunately, I had a Scroll of Escape, as I always did, and began chanting... but something was wrong. It would not spark into life. I began to panic, and looked up to see a sea of Harpies racing towards me.<br><br>Then it happened. The great stone burst into light, into life. I was blinded, filled with its energy, but through the lights I could still see something stranger still happening to me. I started to lift upwards, as though I was being dragged up into the air.<br><br>I felt myself being filled with air, my lungs swelling more than had ever done before. Fear gripped me, and as the light burned brighter, I tilted my head back and screamed. Then nothing. I fell unconscious.<br><br><font color="LEVEL">Continued in the Lana character card</font><br><br><br>
