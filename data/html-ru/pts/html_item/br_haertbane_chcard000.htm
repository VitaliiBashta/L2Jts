"Nobody can stop me!" Ahertbein's broadsword sang as it cut through the beast, splitting it cleanly in two. But there was much more to do: Harpies circled impatiently in the skies above, watching and waiting for the warrior to show his first signs of weakness.<br><br>

Ahertbein's breathing had fast turned hard and heavy; his weapon was impossibly heavy, so great that most men would struggle to lift its full form, and none could effectively wield it. In Ahertbein's hands though... it was something special. People spoke of his inhuman strength, of a blade that crackled with life as it swang, of men trying to block its path with sword and shield and being brushed aside in showers of splinter and steel. But this fight had gone on for too long: Ahertbein was exhausted. He had always thought his death would come in the middle of a golden field, with rainbow blossom dancing around him as he fell. He didn't think his end would come here, in this godforsaken place. He didn't think it would end like this.<br><br>

Of the men who had come with Ahertbein, only one still drew breath, his shield arm had been shredded to ribbons. His sword scratched along bloodied rocks, and his eyes betrayed a failing spirit. Panic set in. The wounded warrior laughed bitterly, throwing his sword to the ground as he cried out "What are you waiting for?!" Ahertbein looked on, his cold blue eyes tracking the creatures above.<br><br>

Suddenly one arched its back, and dived. It was a dark blur, a streaking mess of leathered skin and folded pinions. Sharpened claws pulled out at the last minute, punching through the soldier's torso and holding him in place as the harpy rose back up. He was screaming. The others rushed in, and moments later Ahertbein felt the warm splash of crimson on his neck. Then the screaming stopped.<br><br>

Ahertbein felt the silence in his spine. His heart, still racing from battle, beat louder still in his ears. The harpies finished off their victim, then beady eye after beady eye turned on the young warrior. This was it: fight or flight. Flight. His legs pumped hard, pushing him faster and faster back up the track he had descended. The harpies took flight too, effortlessly gliding overhead, waiting for another to dive first. He ran and ran and ran, his eyes wide with fear, his breathing ragged and desperate.<br><br>

A harpy dove down from the skies and grasped his arm with its claws. This was it. Claws tightened around his forearm, wings strained against his extra weight, but his feet left the ground.<br><br>

At that very moment, a red light burst out from under his feet. It was so bright, so powerful that Ahertbein and this young, starving Harpy could do nothing as they were showered in it, absorbed by its ruby shimmer. There was no time panic, no time to resist.<br><br>

Then something appeared within this red light. A mountain, covered in snow and peaking above silver clouds. It grew fast, rushing towards Ahertbein as he watched.<br><br>

There was an almighty roar, then nothing. The light faded; Ahertbein fell from the sky, his boots and knees crunching into white, cold snow. He kneeled there for a moment, stunned. Even in the darkest taverns in the most fantastical taverns nothing like that had ever been spoken of. He was collecting his thoughts when something cold hit his face. Snow. He looked up, and slowly started to rise to his feet. He was weak, giddy with nerves and exhausted from fighting, when the harpy screamed again, launching himself at the staggering warrior.<br><br>

Ahertbein fell to his back with his greatsword out of reach and the harpy poised above him. It launched its beak down, which he deflected with a muscled forearm. Bones crunched; Ahertbein screamed in agony. The harpy sensed the kill. It readied itself for a final attack, savoring the inevitable meal, when a silver blade burst through the creature's ribcage. The harpy cried out in shock, then fell limp on the sword.<br><br>

"Are you hurt?" A woman's voice was heard, Kamael most likely. Ahertbein looked up to find not only her, but a party of strangers, each wearing a style of outfit that was new to the warrior's eyes. "Don't worry. They're with me." she said, evidently sensing Ahertbein's confusion.<br>He was hurt and tired, and when he eventually spoke, the question he could muster forth was a simple one. "Whe...where am I?"<br><br><br><font color="LEVEL">Continued in the Taman Zu Rapatui character card<br><br></font></BODY></HTML>
