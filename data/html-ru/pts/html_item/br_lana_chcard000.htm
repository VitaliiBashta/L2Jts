<br> <br> <font color="LEVEL">Side Chapter #4</font> <br><br>The girl stared absent-mindedly at the sky, making all sorts of shapes from the clouds above. There was the small little cottage she grew up in, there was a girl dancing... THERE'S A DINOSAUR!<br>There was something even more exciting coming though - Priest Viotin was sailing back right now from the Town of Giran, his pockets filled to the brim with all kinds of candy and sweets! That was why Lana lay there on the grassy hillside, finding shapes in the blossom white clouds: she was waiting impatiently for the priest's boat to pull in.<br><br>

Oh, candy! Lana loved candy. She liked many things, things like animals and dancing, singing and skipping... but most of all, she loved candy. The very word would send her mind tumbling into empires of sugar and chocolate, armies of marshmallows and sherbet. Today was no different.<br><br>

Lana stared at the sea and watched in awed silence as the dark sand turned into ripples of caramel and fudge. She shook herself back to reality, then just as she was looking up and morphing the white clouds in reams of candyfloss when....<br><br>BOOM! BOOOOOOOOOM!!<br>What was that?! An earthquake? Lana felt the earth slip and tilt, the water churned white, and in the distance she could make out great waves cresting. Lana screamed, watching with wide eyes as a huge wave formed, and started rushing towards land. Lana opened her mouth to scream when a burning bright red light shot up into the sky.<br><br>

Lana ran, taking refuge under a fallen tree while great torrents of water crashed around her. Fish rained down too, flung from their habitat by the cascading chaos. Lana looked over the dead bark one more time and saw the tsunami wave growing bigger still. She couldn't swim, she was too close to the water. She ran towards town, her little legs carrying her fast towards home... but not fast enough. The tsunami hit land, and though much of the water's force was spent on the fragile beach, the watery fingers reached forward deeper towards the village. They soon had the young girl, who could do little but scream as she was taken by the wave, and slammed into a small wall. Suddenly she was underwater, clawing at the blurry shapes before her. She couldn't swim. Lana didn't want to die. She screamed out underwater. Bubbles sprang from her mouth and rose to freedom, but she couldn't move, and hopelessly windmilled her arms as the swirling waves tossed her around. She held her breath and closed her eyes. Wishing, willing this to all be a dream. She wanted to wake up in her mother's warm arms and cry her little eyes out, and tell her all about the horrible nightmare she'd had. She wanted to play with her friends and cuddle her dad and go to school and learn and to grow up and... and... she didn't want to die....<br><br>Something happened. Something touched her, but didn't touch her. Something moved her, lifted her. Shapes danced in the lights above. She felt warm, she felt her fading body being lifted. Colors faded, white light was everywhere. Silence, for a second, then rushing water, and... a woman's voice?<br><br>

"Are you alright?" She looked again, blinking until shapes gained definition. There were two figures above her. One was holding her, lifting her from what was seconds from being her watery grave. The woman spoke again, her voice soft and calm.<br><br>

"Hello, Lana. I am Orodriel. You're from the Temple of Einhasad, aren't you?" She blinked again, forcing more definition into the figures above her. Wait... is that... Iken?! Lana knew of Iken, he had been raised by his aunt after his parents died during the war but had always wandered around outside the town by himself. They had never spoken before, in fact she had never seen any of the children speak to him. But there he was, saving her life. Orodriel spoke again.<br><br>

"Fortunately, we were able to cast the Kiss of Eva and stop you drowning just in the nick of time. You're not hurt, are you?" Lana paused. She didn't even know. She moved her limbs, and aside from a bruised side, she seemed fine. She shook her her head, too scared to speak. Orodriel smiled, reaching down to push Lana's hair from her eyes. She went to speak, when it happened again.<br><br>

BOOOOOOOOOOM!!! The ruby light shot up from the sea again, but as a flash this time. The water began to pull itself back towards the sea, taking the Orodriel, Iken and Lana with it.<br><br>

"Hold on!" The three were pulled into a massive whirlpool. It dragged them round, pulling them ever closer towards the core of the vortex. Then they saw it. A door shining in red at the bottom of the whirlpool....<br><br> <br><br><font color="LEVEL">Continued in the Kaurin character card</font><br><br></html></body>
