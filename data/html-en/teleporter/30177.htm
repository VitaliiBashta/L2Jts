Gatekeeper Valentina:

Hello! I am Gatekeeper Valentina, dispatched here from the Ivory Tower. Some people think the Ivory Tower is plotting to dominate the world; others think it's filled with lunatics. Of course, there are a few who see it as our hope for a better, safer world...

What do you think? Are the Ivory Tower's wizards evil, mad...or our salvation?
