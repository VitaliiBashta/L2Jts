Gatekeeper Elisa:

I am Gatekeeper Elisa, one of the stewards of the door of space and time dispatched here from the Ivory Tower. Aden Castle is renowned as a center of politics, culture and religion, but I have been far too busy to sightsee for myself. Ironic, since I regularly send others to destinations far and wide... Silly, isn't it?
