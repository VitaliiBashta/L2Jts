<body>Wilbert:<br> Actually, we once played this game using the images on the Spirit Beads themselves, but it became easier to just use cards marked with images of Suns or Moons. Listen up! There are 10 types of cards, each marked with 1 to 5 <font color = "LEVEL">pictures of the Sun or Moon</font>. Here's how to play: <br>First, cards are dealt to each person in order. The last card drawn is placed face up. <br>Check how many pictures your cards have on them. <br>If there is more than one more card with 5 pictures on it, the person who got the card last wins. <br>Simple, eh? <br>Anything else you'd like to know? <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link quests/_663_SeductiveWhispers/blacksmith_wilbert_q0663_06.htm">"What is a Spirit Bead?" </a> <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link quests/_663_SeductiveWhispers/blacksmith_wilbert_q0663_08.htm">"What do you get when you win the game?"  </a> <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _663_SeductiveWhispers reply_14">"I want to practice."
