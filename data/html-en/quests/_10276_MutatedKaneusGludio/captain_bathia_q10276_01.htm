!Captain Bathis:

I heard tales of your recent activities. You have already acquired a reputation as an accomplished adventurer. Perhaps you have already heard about the *Mutated Kaneus of Kamaloka*. I have been asked to help investigate these strange creatures, but my duties unfortunately keep me far too busy. Perhaps you could help me...
