!Magister Rohmer:

Yes. The journey to reveal the truth about Kamaloka and the Kaneus can now begin in earnest thanks to the tissue samples you provided.

But there are still many Kamalokas to be investigated in this world. And it is vital that we gather information about every Kamaloka. You have already become an important member of this study.

When you reach *level 28*, go to the *Kamaloka in Dion*.

Other captains and magisters will need your help there. Good luck!
