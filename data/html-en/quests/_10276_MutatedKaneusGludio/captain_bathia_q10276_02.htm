!Captain Bathis:

Ah, it's you! Magister Rohmer asked me to convey his gratitude to you. He said that the cellular tissues of the mutated Kaneus from the *Kamaloka of Gludio* that you delivered to the Sages of Magic were a great help.

He has sung your praises throughout the entire territory, in fact! But if you have no more business here in Gludio, I'd suggest that you go to the *Kamaloka of Dion*. I am sure somebody there is in need of your help as well. Farewell, my friend!
