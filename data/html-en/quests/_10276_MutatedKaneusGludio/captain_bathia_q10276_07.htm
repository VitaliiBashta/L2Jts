!Captain Bathis:

Ah! Are these the *cellular tissues of Tomlan Kamos and Ol Ariosh*?

From their pristine appearance, I can tell you were very careful. I couldn't have done better myself. Well done!

Now take these samples to *Magister Rohmer* at the Temple of Einhasad. He will be very pleased.

If we can determine the nature of the mutated Kaneus, your efforts will not be forgotten! But there is no time to waste, so hurry and take these samples to *Magister Rohmer* before they deteriorate!
