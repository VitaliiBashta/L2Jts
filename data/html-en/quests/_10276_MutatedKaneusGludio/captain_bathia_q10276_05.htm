!Captain Bathis:

Excellent! Visit either of the 2 Kamalokas we can enter from Gludio, kill the Kaneus there and extract their cellular tissues.

You will face the *Tomlan Kamos and Ol Ariosh* Kaneus. The Tomlan Kamos is much weaker, so I'd advise that you pursue it first.

When you have extracted all the cellular tissues of the 2 creatures, take them to *Magister Rohmer* at the Temple of Einhasad. I know he and the other Sages will appreciate your efforts.

Good hunting!
