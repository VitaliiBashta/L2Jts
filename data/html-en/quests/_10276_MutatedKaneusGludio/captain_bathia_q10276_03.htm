!Captain Bathis:

The favor I ask is on behalf of *Magister Rohmer* of the Temple of Einhasad. The Sages of Magic, a group of magisters of which Magister Rohmer is a member, are researching the Kaneus: recently discovered monsters of Kamaloka.

They know that Kamaloka exists between this world and the infernal regions; "normal" monsters in that region mutate into the Kaneus.

They do not know the cause of this mutation, however.

To assist their research into this matter, they asked me to obtain some *cellular tissues of the Kaneus*.Will you help me?

*(You may only undertake this quest only if you are eligible to enter Kamaloka, Hall of the Abyss, level 23 and 26.)*
