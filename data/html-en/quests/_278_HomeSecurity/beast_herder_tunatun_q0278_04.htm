Mighty kind of you. Tell you what... I’ll pay you for killing those Sel Mahum *Farm Ravagers or Farm Bandits* on my farm.

I wish I could take your word for it, but I’m gonna need to see some proof before I pay you. Collect *300 Sel Mahum Manes* and bring them back as proof.

A word of warning though... some Sel Mahum can’t grow Manes, so it might take you some time before you find one that does.

Best of luck, stranger.
