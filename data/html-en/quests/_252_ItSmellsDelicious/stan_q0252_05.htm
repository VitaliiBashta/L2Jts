As I expected, they're cooking the dish over their campfires. The soup will soon be mine!

Search their pockets for the recipe. I think the *Sel Mahum Squad Leaders* might keep it with them. They tend to hang around the campfires gobbling up soup. The *Sel Mahum Chef* is another possibility. He carries around the soup and serves it to the squad leaders. I can taste victory already... it will be ours and so will the soup!

Some of the Sel Mahum Squad Leaders doze off around the fires, careful not to wake them. I'll wait right here. Be careful!
