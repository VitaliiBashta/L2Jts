*'I LOVE SALMON SOUP!'

'Man, warms you right up! I need a napkin.. Nah I'll just lick my face!'

'Salmon soup.. Hmm... my newest favorite of everything...'

'Oohh, I don't feel so good. That campfire is making me nauseous...'*

Well, it looks like Sel Mahum Squad Leaders are so busy eating soup and resting that they're not training. Thought you should know. Anyway, thank you. In a minute, I'll belch, and taste that salmon soup one more time. MM-mmm. Take this, it's for the soup.
