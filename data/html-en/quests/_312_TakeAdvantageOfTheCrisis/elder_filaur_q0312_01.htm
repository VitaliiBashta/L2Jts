!Elder Filaur:

Have you heard about the changes in the Mithril Mines? I'm talking about those malicious Wererats that overran the place.

You do know about Wererats, right? Nasty things with face of a rat and those beady, greedy eyes that are always looking for something to steal. And that sound they make....

Now they're in the Mithril Mines!
