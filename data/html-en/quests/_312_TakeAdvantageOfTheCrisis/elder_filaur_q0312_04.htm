!Elder Filaur:

Please destroy the following monsters in the Mithril Mine: *Grave Robber Summoners, Grave Robber Magicians, Grave Robber Workers, Grave Robber Warriors and Grave Robber Insane Warriors*, since they seem to be the chief ones causing the trouble. While you're at it, destroy their subordinates in the Stakato Nest: *Servitors of Darkness, Phantoms of the Mine, Mine Bugs and Earthworm's Descendants*.

Bring me enough *Mineral Fragments* as evidence and I will give you a reward: either a *recipe* or *Premium Materials* containing the secrets of Dwarven armor.

What are you still doing standing there? Get moving!
