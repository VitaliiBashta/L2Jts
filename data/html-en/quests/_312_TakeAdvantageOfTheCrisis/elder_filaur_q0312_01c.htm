!Elder Filaur:

This is a serious issue -- even at full strength, the mine barely keeps pace with the demand for mithril. With much of it closed and our miners afraid to enter...

But we of the Gray Pillar Guild don't intend to simply accept this new state of affairs.

We do need capable adventurers willing to help us cleanse the Mithril Mine. Interested?
