!Elder Filaur:

Hey, you! Why are you still here?

Those monsters won't kill themselves, you know! Hunt *Grave Robber Summoners, Grave Robber Magicians, Grave Robber Workers, Grave Robber Warriors, and Grave Robber Insane Warriors*, as well as their subordinates *Servitors of Darkness, Phantoms of the Mine, Mine Bugs and Earthworm's Descendants*. Then bring me *Mineral Fragments* as evidence. Anything to say for yourself?
