!Elder Filaur:

Have you heard about what's happening in the Mithril Mine? Those nasty Wererats have infested it!

I'm not sure what they are up to, but a powerful evil force is spreading there... You're obviously too inexperienced to do anything useful, though. Take care not to get in the way or you'll probably wind up dead!

(Only characters who are level 80 or higher may undertake this quest.)
