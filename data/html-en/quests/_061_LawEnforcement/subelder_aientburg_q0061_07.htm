!Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:

Yes. An Inspector searches and judges, but a Judicator is required to make an unexpected leap in judgment. In so doing, he opens the path to the future development of the Kamael.

In the past, when this island was sealed, it was enough for us merely to maintain the edge of the sword, but now that sword has been unsheathed and we must decide where and how to wield it.

To lead our race effectively, our *power* must now be spread throughout the world. rallying, leading, advising, helping.

The true strength of our power is not our skill with the blade or ability in battle. It is, rather, the self-awareness to transcend the limits imposed on us so long ago. Do you understand?
