!Daichir, Priest of Earth:

Have you heard about the Ratmen's damaging the magical shield deep inside the Mithril Mine? Now the mine has been shut down and all the miners have been forced to evacuate.

If the shield is completely destroyed...well, I shudder to think what will happen!

Will you help us prevent that?
