Hmm...this isn't what I expected...

Do you have any more pieces of the key or another Records Chest?

If you don't, please go to the *Field of Silence* and get rid of the *Tasaba Lizardmen and Tasaba Lizardman Shaman* there. Once you have done so, you will be able to obtain *both the pieces of the key to the Records Chest and the Records Chest itself*.
