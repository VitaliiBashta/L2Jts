!Shilen's Stone Statue:

*The eldest daughter of Einhasad and Gran Kain* is inquiring about you.

You stem from the Lizardman race, but you are now a part of the Elroki tribe that was born from the energy of water and prospered under the protection of the water goddess Shilen. Is this true?

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _126_IntheNameofEvilPart2 reply_4a|Say yes]

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _126_IntheNameofEvilPart2 statue_of_shilen_q0126_09.htm|Say honestly that you are not a native Elrokian.]
