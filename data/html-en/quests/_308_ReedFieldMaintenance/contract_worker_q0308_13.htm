I like the way that you work. Dedicated. Get back to the fields and get rid of the Mucrokian threat. Remember to collect hides from the *Mucrokian Fanatic, Mucrokian Ascetic, Mucrokian Savior, Mucrokian Preacher, and Contaminated Mucrokian*...

Oh, and if you get an *Awakened Mucrokian Hide*, that reduces the amount of hides required to claim a reward.

See ya in a bit.
