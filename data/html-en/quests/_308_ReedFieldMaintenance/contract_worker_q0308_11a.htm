!Katensa:

I like how you are impatient to settle even with a loss on your books. Do you have the required number of Mucrokian Skins or Awakened Mucrokian Skins ready?

As I told you, I will pay you twice for the Awakened Mucrokian Skins obtained from the Awakened Mucrokians. Also, when calculating for the Dynasty ingredient item, I will calculate the Awakened Mucrokians first. Now, what will you receive?
