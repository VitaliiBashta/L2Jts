<HTML><HEAD><BODY>Kantabilon:<br>Hmm. In order to fix this sound crystal, you need a talon from the Malruk Succubus. Without such an exquisite and delicate tool, this sound crystal cannot be repaired. Other tools are too clumsy and they will destroy the delicate item. Please go to the Watcher's Tomb and bring back some talons of the Malruk Succubus. We will need at least 10.</BODY></HTML>
