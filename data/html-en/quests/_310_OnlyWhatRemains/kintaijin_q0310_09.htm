!Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:

Well done. You brought the correct numbers? Let me confirm it.

Hmm, they are surely 500 Dirty Bead. Here, take this Growth Accelerator.

And let me give you some Multi-Colored Bright Ore. You can come near me from anywhere when you use it.

...Do you have any other business?
