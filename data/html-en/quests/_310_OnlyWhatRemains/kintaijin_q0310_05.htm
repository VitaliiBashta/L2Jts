!Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:

My examination of the bead has led me to two conclusions.

One is that the Dirty Bead had traces of Haari's blood on it, which leads me to believe he is dead. The second thing I concluded was that this bead is part of a necklace ... an artifact from my village, actually ... that Haari had stolen before disappearing.

While I would have preferred to bring in Haari himself, if I were able to retrieve the pieces of this necklace, I might be able to restore a piece of my village's history.

Would you help me find all the pieces?
