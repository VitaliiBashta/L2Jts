!Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:

Dirty Beads can be found on the corpses of the *Spiked Stakato and Cannibal Stakato* creatures found inside the Stakato's Nest. I'll need you to find 500 of these beads. Bring them back to me, and I will reward you for your hard work.

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _310_OnlyWhatRemains reply_12|"I will find the beads and be back shortly."]
