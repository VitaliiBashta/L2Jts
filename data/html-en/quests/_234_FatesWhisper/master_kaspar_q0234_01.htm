<html><head><body>Magister Kaspar:<BR>Ah, you must have come for Maestro Reorin's Mold. How is 
Reorin? <BR>I should check you out. Uh oh, did I say that out loud? Sorry... I 
was just talking to myself.<BR>If you knew what I went throught to get this 
mold, you would understand why I can't just give it to you for nothing... If you 
ask me to set a price on it, I will set it so high that you could not possibly 
afford it. But there is another way you can get it. Perhaps you could do a favor 
for me...<BR><A action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _234_FatesWhisper menu_select?ask=234&reply=1">"What do you
