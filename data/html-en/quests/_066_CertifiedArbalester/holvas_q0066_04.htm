He cannot be found -- and neither can the manuscript. <BR>Would you be willing to find the pieces of the manuscript?<BR>If you gather all the pieces and bring them to me, I will bind a book for you free of charge.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _066_CertifiedArbalester reply_3">Agree.</a></body></html>
