<body>Lady of the Lake:<br>Don't you know who I am?<br>My mother lost everything that she loved, and her grief over the betrayal was overpowering. I am the child who holds hope and faith in the future. Some call me the Goddess of Water, but that title really belongs to my sister. My name is Eva.<br>I will give my trust to a mortal over my own siblings, if they recite with conviction, and believe in that new future. Can you do that?<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _247_PossessorOfaPreciousSoul4 menu_select?ask=247&reply=3">"I will with my entire body and soul."</a></body></html>
