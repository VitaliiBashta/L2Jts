!Armor Trader Radia:

Welcome, stranger! What can I do for you?

Nice ring! Are you here to propose to me?

Just kidding! Don't tell me you thought I was serious!?

Oh, you're here for Leikar's order? Sorry, it hasn't come in yet. Maybe you should check with Varan in the Town of Gludio. I've been expecting a shipment from him.
