<html><head><body>Magister Joan:<BR>Ah, it's you again! I'm so dreadfully sorry about the 
confusion last time. Yes, about your pay... I apologize, I'm waiting for 
approval and a check from the home office...<BR>... err, ummm...<BR>To tell you 
the truth, I hired you without the approval of the Grand Magisters of the Ivory 
Tower! You may be waiting a very, very, very long time for your compensation. 
Please forgive me! I am so ashamed of myself... I'm always getting into trouble. 
I'm also stubborn! And obsessive-compulsive! Is that a bad thing?<BR>... By the 
way, who in the world are you? </BODY></HTML>
