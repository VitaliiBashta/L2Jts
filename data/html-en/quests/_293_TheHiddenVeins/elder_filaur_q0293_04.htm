As I mentioned before, I will reward you based on the amount of <font color="LEVEL">Chrysolite Ore</font> that you collect after defeating <font color="LEVEL">the Utuku Orcs</font>.<br>And don't forget ...<font color="LEVEL">If you collect four pieces of a torn Map,</font> you should visit Chichirin in the Maphr Temple. If you ask her for help, she will combine those torn pieces and make a complete Map. I will give you a generous reward once you bring me the completed Maps.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _293_TheHiddenVeins reply_1">Say you will quit</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _293_TheHiddenVeins reply_2">Say you will continue</a></body></html>
