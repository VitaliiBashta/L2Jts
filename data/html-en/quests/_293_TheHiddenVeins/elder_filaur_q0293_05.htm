<html><head><body>Filaur of the Gray Pillar:<br>You've done well, young Dwarf. This ore you have brought may look rough, but once it goes through the trained hands of craftsmen, it becomes a precious metal with a brilliant blue luster. True maestros should be able to find the beauty hidden in plain objects.<br>As promised, I will reward you based on the amount of ore you have brought. And, don't forget ... If you collect <font color="LEVEL">four pieces of a torn Map,</font> you should visit Chichirin in the Maphr Temple. If you ask her for help, she will combine those torn pieces and make a complete Map. I will give you a generous reward once you bring me the completed Maps.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _293_TheHiddenVeins reply_1">Say you will quit</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _293_TheHiddenVeins reply_2">Say you will continue</a></body></html>
