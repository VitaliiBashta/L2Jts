!Water Dragon's Shamaness Parme:

(Suddenly, an ethereal and sorrowful melody begins to flow from the Echo Crystal you received from Kanis.

The Shamaness' body is engulfed in light, and her eyes come back into focus as she clutches her head and shrieks in pain.

A moment later...

She seems to recover, although still appears somewhat disoriented.)

Wh...who...are you?

And where...am I?
