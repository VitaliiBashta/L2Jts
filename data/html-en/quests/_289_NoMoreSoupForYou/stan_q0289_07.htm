!Guard Stan:

You came back! You crushed their spirits and took their soup, right? And you did a good job protecting this village.. which is supposed to be my job.

Your work should be compensated so I'll make you a good deal. I'll count two empty soup containers as one full soup container. So let's soup it up! Unless you want more untasty fruits...
