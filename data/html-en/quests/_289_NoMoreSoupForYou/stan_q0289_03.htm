!Guard Stan:

Know what? No soup for them! I eat the soup because I protect the village, I need that deliciousness in my belly to keep strong and sharp.

We need to keep the Sel Mahum from using the power of the soup. I sure could use your help with that. Will you answer the call to defend my soup?
