!Guard Stan:

Alright, here's the plan. I want you to collect as many of their soup barrels as you can find. You'll find them on the *Sel Mahum Squad Leaders*, the biggest soup eaters of them all. The *Chef* will probably have some too. There are some Sel Mahum Guards that guard the Chef, 'cause that's what guards do (I should know, I'm a guard). They'll also probably be carrying barrels with them.

Here, I'll give you these *untasty, foul fruits*. All you have to do is find a campfire where soup is cooking and toss them in. *When the monsters eat it, they'll get sick and much easier to beat!*

Bring me at least 100 barrels and I'll give you something neat. Bring me more and maybe I'll give you something neater!
