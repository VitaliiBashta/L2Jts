!Engineer Lekon:

It would be easier if I went with you, but unfortunately I'm far too busy. I've prepared this *Star Stone Collection Scroll* to help beginners like you. Use it near a target and you'll do fine. It's not cheap, though, so I hope you'll learn the collection skill while using it.

Your task is to bring me 8 of the following Extracted Star Stones- either *8 Extracted Coarse Red Star Stones, 8 Extracted Coarse Blue Star Stones, or 8 Extracted Coarse Green Star Stones* using the *Star Stone Collection Scrolls*.

These star stones can be found in the skies around the Keucereus Alliance Base and on the paths to the Seeds and the Aerial Cleft. Good luck!
