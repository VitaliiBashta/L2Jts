!Mad Doctor Orpheus:

We are treading on dangerous ground here, my friend! We are entering the realm of gods! Unless you fully appreciate the gravity of our situation you are bound for torment and tragedy! Yes, yes, dangerous ground indeed...

I have many enemies, not least among them those who envy my drive and ambition. Some of those idiots even accuse me of being a graverobber! Bwa ha ha ha ha!
