!Locksmith Dorothy:

Good! I think we'll get along just fine. All right, let me sum it up for you.

Treasure! The treasure of Pirate King Zaken! Using this information, my friends were able to steal some of Zaken's treaure from Devil's Isle. But before they reached me they were all eaten by Crokians on Alligator Beach. I searched up and down, but I couldn't find track or trace of any treasure. Either it was taken somewhere or it's inside the bellies of the Crokians.
