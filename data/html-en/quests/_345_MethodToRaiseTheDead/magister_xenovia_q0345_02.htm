Well, we certainly aren't trying to keep anyone from using the urn that wants to... I suppose you will be wanting to summon a departed one's soul? I'm sorry, my friend, but the powder you need will not come for free... It may not look like much, but it is the property of the guild... A pouch of it will cost you 1,000 Adena.
