<html><head> <body>Captain Alex:<br>I thank you for that, I truly do. As the captain of the militia, it'll relieve me, as well as the chief, to put the souls of our dead militiamen to rest. No reward could match the great service you've done us, and I have precious little to give besides our thanks.  But the chief entrusted me with something for a great-hearted adventurer and, by thunder, I see one before me now. Please accept it, and let's hope for better days for our struggling village.<br> <a action = "bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link quests/_660_AidingtheFloranVillage/alankell_q0660_07.htm">I will continue to help the Floran farmers.</a> <br><a action = "bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _660_AidingtheFloranVillage menu_select?ask=660&reply=20">I will now embark on a new adventure.</a></body></html>
