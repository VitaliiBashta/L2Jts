<html><head> <body>Captain Alex:<br>Soldier, I can't thank you enough.  You've helped our farming community enormously, and we all appreciate it.  It's not much, but Timothy wanted me to give you something as an extra reward for your help.  It's of no economic value, but it's a gift, and you'd oblige us both by taking it.  And, again, my undying thanks.<br> <a action = "bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link quests/_660_AidingtheFloranVillage/alankell_q0660_07.htm">I will continue to help the Floran farmers.</a> <br><a action = "bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _660_AidingtheFloranVillage menu_select?ask=660&reply=20">I will now embark on a new adventure.</a></body></html>
