Wow, you really ARE ready for anything! Ha!

Alright, let's talk business. We need the best meat, if the beasts aren't big enough then the meat isn't ready. The young ones taste okay, but if we don't provide the best someone else will.

For a good harvest we'll need *about 120 units...* That would turn a nice profit. Vladimir will decide if the meat is good enough. Ahh.. I love a good beast hunt. Let's get it done!
