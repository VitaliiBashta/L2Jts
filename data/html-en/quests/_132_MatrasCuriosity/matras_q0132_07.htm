!Matras:

I am going to tell you this secret because I only found out about it thanks to your help. Apparently, there is a *passage that leads directly to the second tower of the Steel Citadel*. I found it easily enough, and I think you will, too. In fact, if you want to use that passage, go speak with *Deltuva*. Since you helped me by obtaining the blueprint, I know he will help you. May Maphr protect you!
