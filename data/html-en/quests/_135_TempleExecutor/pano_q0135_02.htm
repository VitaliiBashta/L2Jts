!Grocer Pano:

Oh, you are the adventurer from the association. Thank the goddess!

Listen, I'm in a real fix. My business has struggled lately, so I borrowed some money from some people I shouldn't have. Now they've raised the interest so much that I can't afford to pay them back!

I begged them to have mercy on me, but they just laughed -- then they told me, sneering, that they would write off my debt if only I bring them 10 Hate Crystals.

But how can a peaceful trader like me deal with the dangerous monsters who have the Crystals?

You look like a strong and resourceful adventurer -- would you help me? Please, I beg you...

Alex can give you more information about the monsters who have the *Hate Crystals*.
