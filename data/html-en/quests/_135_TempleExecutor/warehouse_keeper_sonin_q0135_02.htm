!Warehouse Keeper Sonin:

Oh, you are the adventurer sent by the Temple.

Thank the goddess! I am in real trouble! The cargo in the warehouse was stolen by thieves!

I can't emphasize enough what a disaster this is...

Since I became an assistant, things have gone from bad to worse.

Can you help me?

...

*Alex* can tell you more about the thieves who stole the cargo.
