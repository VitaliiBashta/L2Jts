!Priest Shegfield:

What are you talking about?

Tithing is a holy duty, a sacred obligation, for the people of the goddess, but we do not force it on anyone. The villagers contributed of their own free will... It is admirable that they have continued to do so in the face of hardship. The goddess will be pleased with their devotion.

In any event, congratulations! You have gained the title of the "Hands of the Temple." Before I give you the certificate of office, I will tell you what you should know in your new role.
