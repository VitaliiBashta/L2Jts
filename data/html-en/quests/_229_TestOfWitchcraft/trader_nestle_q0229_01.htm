Trader Nestle:<br>Ah, the <font color="LEVEL">Jewel of Aklantoth</font>. I commissioned Trader Alexandria of Giran to sell it at auction. There were originally 6 jewels in the set, but unfortunately we have only acquired 3 of them so far. If I had the whole set I could get a much higher price...<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _229_TestOfWitchcraft menu_select?ask=229&reply=1">"Where were the jewels found?"</a></body></html>
