!Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:

Billy Haari. He is the most despicable and loathsome being in existance.

Extortion, treason, fraud. You name it and he is guilty of it. The village I came from was just a stepping stone for Haari. By the time he disappeared, there wasn't one life in the town he hadn't damaged.

It was said that he sought refuge here in the Stakato's Nest. And although I've done much searching, I still don't know whether he is dead or alive. What I do know is that, the more monsters you kill, the easier it will be for me to get back in their and search for that criminal.
