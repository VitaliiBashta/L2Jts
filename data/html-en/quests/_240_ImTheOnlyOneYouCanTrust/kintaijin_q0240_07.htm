!Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:

As you can see, I'm a bounty hunter. And generally, I do what I do for the money. But this one is personal to me.

I'm here to bring in Billy Haari for his crimes.

And I almost had him ... until he ran into the Stakato's Nest. I'm good at what I do. But this place is a bit too much for even me.
