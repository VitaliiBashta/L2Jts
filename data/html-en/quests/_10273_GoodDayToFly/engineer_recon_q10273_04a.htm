!Engineer Lekon:

When the Seed suddenly appeared in Gracia, the Aurabirds' spirit protected them from the contamination that affected the other creatures. They flew here to the Keucereus Alliance Base, where the power of the Seed is weakest. I guess they wanted to survive.

A few of us were interested in the origins and biology of the Aurabirds. But more wanted to find a way to use them in the war effort.

An Aurabird is big enough for even a young Orc to ride, after all! Several of us thought they held the key to avoiding dependence on Airships.
