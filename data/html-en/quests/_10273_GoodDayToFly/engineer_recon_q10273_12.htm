!Engineer Lekon:

How did it go? Ah, I was right about you. I knew you would succeed! (Ah, this one will be very useful to us...)

Huh? What's that? Oh, it's nothing -- just talking to myself. Very well, let me write out your certificate.

(He writes something on a paper.)

With this, nobody will question your right to fly.

I will also give you a spellbook that describes how to transform into your choice of Aurabird. Use it and I think you'll be able to fly in the Gracian skies without any help from me.

Good luck!
