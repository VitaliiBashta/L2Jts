!Engineer Lekon:

Any skilled adventurer in Gracia is permitted to fly. *Hunting* and *collecting* are possible up there too.

Of course, you will need to pass a simple test to prove that you're a match for any of the monsters you might encounter. I'm not worried about you, though! So how about it? Would you like to take the test?
