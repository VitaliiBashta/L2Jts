!Engineer Lekon:

You must select a type of Aurabird. There are two types to choose from.

When the Aurabird was first created during the Age of the Giants, it is said they altered several species. However, only two types survived after the fall of the Giants.

One is called the *Aurabird Falcon*, which has a penchant for melee type attacks and flies very fast. The other is called the *Aurabird Owl*, which leans more towards magic type attacks.The Aurabird Owl flies more slowly, but has easier maneuverability.

Which type do you want to be transformed into?
