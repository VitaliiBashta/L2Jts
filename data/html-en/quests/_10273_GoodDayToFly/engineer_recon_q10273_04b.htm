!Engineer Lekon:

If the method was easy, we would have certainly have used it before now. We did find some ancient historical documents, but until recently we were unable to successfully duplicate the process. Only through the efforts of several Necromancers, the Wizards of the Ivory Tower and Dwarven technology were we finally able to do it.

Our process magically transforms a person to provide Aurabird activity without changing the person's original shape.

For it to be effective, the user must have transformation capability and possess certain magical items.
