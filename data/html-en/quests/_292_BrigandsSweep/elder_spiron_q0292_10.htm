<html><head><body>Elder Spiron:<br>Well done! As promised, I will reward you based on the number and type of necklaces you have brought after killing the goblins. Their spirits must be significantly deflated!<br>What is this, a Contract ...? This is the Suspicious Memos all combined! Let me see ... Hmm ... Yes ... As I thought ...<font color="LEVEL">The goblins were hired by the Silver Scale Guild.</font> I can't believe Balanki would hatch such a bold plot ... Well, I must do something!<br>Going straight to the Guild Elder Council is not much fun ... I think meeting Balanki and coming to a mutual agreement is better! I finally have his weak point ... He must pay a high price for his actions!<br>Thanks to you, I have obtained valuable information. Since I am a fair Dwarf, I will reward you additionally for your unexpected achievement. Many thanks for your troubles!<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _292_BrigandsSweep menu_select?ask=292&reply=1">Say you will quit</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _292_BrigandsSweep menu_select?ask=292&reply=2">Say you will continue</a></body></html>
