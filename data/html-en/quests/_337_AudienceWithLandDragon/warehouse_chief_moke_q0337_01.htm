!Warehouse Chief Moke:

Is that a Feather of Gabrielle? Allow me to introduce myself again. I am Moke, watcher of the seal. I was trained by the Gray Pillar Guild. I am currently employed as a warehouse keeper, guarding the Bronze Gate.

For generations we Dwarves have used the power of a seal to bind the evil spirits of Shilen within columns. As long as a column remains upright, evil spirits cannot escape the power of the seal.

Unfortunately, the column restraining the evil dragon Antharas is under attack. The followers of the beast are attempting to free their master by using an Abyssal Jewel.
