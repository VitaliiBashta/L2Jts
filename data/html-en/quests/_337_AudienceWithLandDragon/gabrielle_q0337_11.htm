!Gabrielle:

Thanks to you, the evil plan to free Antharas has been thwarted. Unfortunately the conspirators escaped, but for the time being they will not threaten us again.

I hereby bestow upon you the Herald of Slayer. You must now confront the tyrant of the land, the disaster of Giran, the evil dragon Antharas.

Time is of the essence. You must travel to the entrance of Dragon Valley and meet Land Dragon Watcher Gilmore there. Don't let his wicked appearance frighten you. He is one of the original 17 guardians that sealed Antharas. He became an undead in order to honorably fulfill his role. He will show you how to enter Antharas' Lair. May the blessings of Einhasad be with you!
