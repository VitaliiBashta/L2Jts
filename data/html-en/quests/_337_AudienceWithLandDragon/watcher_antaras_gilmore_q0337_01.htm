!Antharas Watchman Gilmore:

*Gabrielle* leads the seal watchmen. She can be found in *the Town of Giran*.

Before you make up your mind, you must consider the fact that any battle with Antharas will be to the death. If you are determined to meet Antharas, you should first meet Gabrielle and the other watchmen and collect their marks.

When you have collected all the marks of the watchmen, Gabrielle will give you a *Herald of a Slayer*. Bring it to me.
