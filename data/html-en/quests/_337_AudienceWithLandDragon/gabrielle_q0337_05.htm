!Gabrielle:

You must visit each guardian of the seal and perform whatever task they ask of you. The guardians are quite reserved, but are brothers joined in strong union with a clear sense of mission. Show them this feather and they will know of your intention to join the expedition against Antharas.

There are a total of four guardians that you must meet. They are *Magister Kaiena at the Ivory Tower*, *Prefect Chakiris in Hunters Village*, *Master Kendra* and *High Priest Orven of the Town of Aden*. If you complete the tasks that they give you and bring the *Marks of Watchman*, I'll show you how to enter the force field that surrounds Antharas' Lair.

You must realize that these tasks will be difficult. You should consider asking any comrades you may have to join our expedition. Choose only those that you can live and die with. If you would trust them with your life, tell them to come and visit me. I will also give them this test and my feather mark.

Remember, from ancient times warriors have learned that battles are won when comrades join together to defeat a common enemy.  May the divine protection of Einhasad be with you...
