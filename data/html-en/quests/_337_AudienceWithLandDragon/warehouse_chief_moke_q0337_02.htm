!Warehouse Chief Moke:

An Abyssal Jewel is used to focus the power of dark magic into one place. The followers of Antharas are attempting to breach the force field that binds their master. If they are successful it will mean the end of us all. No more tomorrows! We must destroy the Abyssal Jewel as soon as we can!

It is located on the *northwest shore of Gludio*. You must hurry there  with your comrades and dash the jewel to bits.

You must beware. Dark spirits guard the Abyssal Jewel. They will attack and try to stop you. You must kill them all. If any are allowed to survive they could reconstitute the jewel.

You have your assignment. Bring me a *fragment of the Abyssal Jewel* and *proof that you have slain a jewel guardian*. When you bring these things to me I will give you my Mark of Watchman.
