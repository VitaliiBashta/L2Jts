!Antharas Watchman Gilmore:

I can feel a strong dark energy in the valley... If you don't hurry and destroy the *Abyss Jewel,* Antharas will awaken even before you step into the dragon's nest. Hurry. Kill the *Cave Keepers and Cave Maidens,* then destroy the jewel! Take the jewel shards and go find *Antharas Watchman Theodric.* He guards the entrance to Antharas' nest in the deepest part of the dragon's valley.
