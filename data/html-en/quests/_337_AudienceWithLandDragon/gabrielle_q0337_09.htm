!Gabrielle:

You have obtained the recognition of the four guardians. This demonstrates that you have the strength to confront and fight Antharas. Only one task awaits before you can set out to slay the dragon. Evil forces have appeared, threatening the force field that restrains Antharas. Those evildoers intend to use a device called an Abyssal Jewel to gather dark magic and destroy the force field. You must go to* Warehouse Chief Moke of Gludin Town *and* Blacksmith Helton of the Town of Oren*. They are guardians of the seal. They will be able to tell you more of the details of this nefarious plot. Show them the feather mark that I have given you. They will recognize it.

This mission is vital to the expedition to destroy Antharas. If you fail and the force field is destroyed, Antharas will be undefeatable!
