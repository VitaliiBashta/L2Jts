!Antharas Watchman Theodric:

Is this a fragment of the Abyssal Jewel? I'll give it to the Dwarves of the Gray Pillar Guild! They will melt it to nothing in their supreme furnace! The wicked followers of Antharas will never be able to use it to commit evil acts again.

Now you must confront Antharas. You have not gotten much encouragement from me up to now, have you? Well, my friend, the fact that you are still breathing is a sign of your indomitable resolve... So, I won't stand in your way. Good luck!
