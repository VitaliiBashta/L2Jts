!Antharas Watchman Theodric:

You may have the Mark of Watchman from Gabrielle, but I cannot allow you to enter Antharas' nest right now. We are in an urgent situation where the restraints on Antharas' power are being threatened. You can hear the specifics from *Antharas Watchman Gilmore,* who is guarding the entrance to the dragon valley. I cannot give you a Portal Stone until this situation is resolved.
