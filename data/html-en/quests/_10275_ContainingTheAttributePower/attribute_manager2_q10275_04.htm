!Attribute Master Yang:

I appreciate your help. Unfortunately, it won't be easy. You must recapture the *Reckless Sprites of Wind* using this device.

They are still precious experimental subjects, remember. If they are killed, all our work will have been in vain.

This device changes the materialized energy into a form we can still use. That should allow me to continue my research.

One more thing: the device's power is limited, and it will disappear after *10 minutes*. Please act quickly!
