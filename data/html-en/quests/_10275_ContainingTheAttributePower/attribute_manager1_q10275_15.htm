!Attribute Master Yin:

You succeeded! Thank you.

I'd like to give you something as a reward, but all that I have here are my research notes about attributes. Hmm...I can give you an Attribute Ore.  It has value, so you won't regret acccepting it.

Since you have completed my request twice, I'll give you 2 Ores reflecting the attribute of your choosing. Now, which ones do you want?
