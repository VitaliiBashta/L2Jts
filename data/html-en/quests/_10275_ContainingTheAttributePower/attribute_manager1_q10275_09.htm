!Attribute Master Yin:

An excellent start! Considering the time limit, you did very well.

But you have not yet caught enough of the creatures. As things now stand, our experiment is still in danger.

Please -- I still need your help. Capture more *Reckless Sprites of Water*. This time, I will use my magic to help you.
