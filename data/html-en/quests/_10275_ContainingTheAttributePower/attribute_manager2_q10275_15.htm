!Attribute Master Yang:

You succeeded! Thank you.

I'd like to give you something as a reward, but all that I have here are my research notes about attributes. Hmm...I can give you an Ore of Attribute. It has value, so you won't regret acccepting it.

Since responded to my request twice, I'll give you 2 Ores of Attribute of your choosing. Now, which ones do you want?
