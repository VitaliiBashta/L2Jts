!Attribute Master Yin:

I appreciate your help. Unfortunately, it won't be easy. You must recapture the *Reckless Sprites of Water* using this device.

They are still precious experimental subjects, remember. If they are killed, all our work will have been in vain.

This device changes the materialized energy of the Sprites to *Reckless Sprite Piece - Water*. Collect at least *6* of them. That should be enough to allow me to continue my research.

One more thing: the device's power is limited, and it will disappear after *10 minutes*. Please act quickly!
