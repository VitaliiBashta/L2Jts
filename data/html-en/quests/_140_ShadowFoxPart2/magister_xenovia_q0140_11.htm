!Magister Xenovia:

Ah! I see that you have brought the Dark Crystal...

I will give you 3 solutions.

You can continue the experiment by choosing one of them.

You will need 5 Dark Crystals for each experiment.

One of the 3 solutions will be able to produce Dark Oxide.

Please choose carefully...
