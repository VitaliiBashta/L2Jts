!Magister Xenovia:

Go to *Alligator Beach* and hunt *Crokians, Dailaons, Crokian Warriors and Farhites*, and bring me the *Dark Crystals* you collect there.

You need at least 5 in order to conduct a single experiment.

If the experiments are successful, you can acquire *Dark Oxides*.

Bring me *3 Dark Oxides* and I will give you the *Cryptogram of the Sword of the Goddess*.
