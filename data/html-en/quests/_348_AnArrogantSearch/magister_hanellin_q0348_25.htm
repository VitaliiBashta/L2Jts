!Magister Hanellin:

Why are you still here? You must hurry! These sort of affairs inevitably attract troublemakers, we must be very careful. I have received an urgent request for help from the Dark Elf Village. *Magister Harne* is expecting you there. If you dawdle you will incur the wrath of at least two powerful Dark Elven magisters. All your travel expenses will be covered! Leave immediately!
