!Magister Hanellin:

The three sacred relics are contained in three separate arks and hidden in Aden, Giran and somewhere in the Dark Elven Forest across the Misty Mountains.

We Dark Elves have a great natural interest in the Tower of Insolence and Baium.

Please go and meet with *Madam Claudia Athebaldt* in this village. She has been searching in this area for the ark for quite a while. I believe she has made some progress. I am fairly sure that she can be found strolling in the flower garden near Aden Castle... If you show her this letter, she will tell you where the ark is.
