Well, I suppose I will have to tell you now, since you'll have to deliver the items to them anyway...

First is *Sir Gustav Athebaldt of the Town of Oren*. He is a black-hearted scoundrel, a distant relative of Claudia Athebaldt. He has been secretly supporting young warlords and expanding his power base. 

The second person is *Hardin.* I need not say more, right? I hesitate to even call him human...

And, finally, there is *Iason Heine of Heine*... He dreams of one day taking over Innadril with the influence of his wealth. He is the biggest financier of this project. Take the blood-soaked cloths to these people. Your compensation will await your return.
