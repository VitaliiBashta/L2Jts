!Magister Hanellin:

Oh, you're back! Did you bring what I asked for? Oh, thank you! Please give them to me! I'll just mix them up and...(Gulp Gulp) Ahh~! I feel much better.

My research is complete. I wove the incantation from the book of the saint and the branch of the saint into the fabric that will activate the Angelic Vortex. However, it will take more that this to activate the vortex. I'll tell you more when the others get here. Give one cloth to each of your comrades, keep on for yourself and then come back to see me. Until then...
