!Magister Hanellin:

The story of the construction of the Tower of Insolence and the defeat of Baium is recorded in the book of the saint. However, the book itself does not impart knowledge. About 20 years ago a book was circulated purporting to be a copy... It was total rubbish. It was a book of hymns, so shabbily written that it could hardly have been produced by a saint! Besides, the book was full of modern grammar, and couldn't have come from ancient times. Perhaps the saint did not just write the secrets in her book. Perhaps her staff may actually conceal a key to all of the mysteries of the book...
