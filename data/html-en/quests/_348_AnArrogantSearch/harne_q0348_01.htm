!Magister Harne:

Would you please give me the letter given to you by Magister Hanellin?

Now you shall learn the results of our investigation. The ark can be found in the *northern Marshland along the eastern edge of the Misty Mountains*. We do not yet know its specific location as they do in Aden and Giran, but as in those places we expect it to be protected by a *Guardian of the Ark*. You must search for the ark where I said. If you find it, open it and retrieve the sacred relic contained within. I wish you all the best.
