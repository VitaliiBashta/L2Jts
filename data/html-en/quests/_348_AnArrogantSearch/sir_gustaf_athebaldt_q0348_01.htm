!Sir Gustav Athebaldt:

You were sent by Magister Hannelin, correct? You're late! Now hurry and give me the items before someone sees you!

She was going to send me three pieces of "the blood of the angel"... is this it?! Ha! What a novel idea--I didn't know what to expect when she spoke of blood in terms of pieces....

Well, this has already been paid for, so you've nothing to take back. Leave, before I show you the back of my hand! Off with you!
