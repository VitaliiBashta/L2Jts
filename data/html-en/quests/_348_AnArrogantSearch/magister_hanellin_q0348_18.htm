!Magister Hanellin:

The three sacred relics are contained in three separate arks and hidden in Aden, Giran and somewhere in the Dark Elven Forest across the Misty Mountains.

We Dark Elves have a great natural interest in the Tower of Insolence and Baium. Not long ago the lover of a former chief created a huge ruckus in the tower...

You must go to the Dark Elf Village and meet with *Magister Harne*. She recently sent word that she had located the ark in the Dark Elven Forest. There seemed to be something wrong, but she didn't go into it. I realize this is a long journey, but could you please go and check it out? Take this letter with you.
