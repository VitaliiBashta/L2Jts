!Magister Hanellin:

Good job! Thank you for your hard work. We haven't heard the last of those three, I guarantee... Ha! They may be a lot of trouble, but the money is good, no? Here is the compensation I promised. What do you want to do now? I still have quite a bit of work to do. Would you like to continue working with me or do you want to quit?
