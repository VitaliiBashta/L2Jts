!Magister Hanellin:

Listen carefully. Soak the White Fabric in the blood of *Platinum tribe shamans and overlords* and wrap yourself in it. The Angelic Vortex will accept you.

This money should cover your travel expenses, with a little something extra for your trouble... I'm sorry that it can't be more.

Once you pass through the vortex you should go immediately to the emperor. There will be no need for you to return here.

You'll find the Tower of Insolence is much more dangerous than you've anticipated. You may not survive...

Stop sniveling! If you're not up to it, then don't do it! Whatever you choose, good luck!
