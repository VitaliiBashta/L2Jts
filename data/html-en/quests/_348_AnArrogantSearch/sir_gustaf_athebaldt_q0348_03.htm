!Sir Gustav Athebaldt:

Did Magister Hanellin send you? Quickly, come here!

Give me the order that I placed then, quickly now, before we're seen.

Ah! Blood soaked fabric--very ingenious... but this fabric couldn't possibly contain the three samples of blood that I ordered. There must have been an error....

I need you to head back and get the rest of the supplies for me, understand?
