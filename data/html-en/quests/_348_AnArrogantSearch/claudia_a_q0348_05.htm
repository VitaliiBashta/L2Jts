!Lady Claudia:

Ah, the book of the saint! So this is what was contained in the ark of Aden for so long? Remarkable....

You know you didn't need to bring it here, but I must admit it gives me a great deal of satisfaction to finally see the fruits of our labors. Magister Hanellin believes this book to be complete garbage, a collection of totally worthless sacred songs, but... have you read it? Could you make head or tail of it?

I think it will be interesting to see something so old at any rate; so much can be inferred from incidental details like the phrasing of a sentence, and twist a book's writer puts on certain events.

Now hurry and take the blood of the saint, the branch of the saint and this to Magister Hanellin.

Hurry along my friend - may our next meeting take place under clearer skies!
