!Magister Hanellin:

How much do you know about the Platinum tribe? They were ordered by the gods to guard Baium... They will not let anyone in or out of his room... They will even attempt to kill anyone who dares approach the top floor where the throne is located!

Although their devotion to their job is admirable, they stand between us and the king.
