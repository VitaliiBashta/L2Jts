!Magister Hanellin:

The Book of Saint, the Bough of Saint, and the Blood of Saint! Finally, the three holy items have gathered in one place. You did well, truly. I will use these to find a way for you to stand up to the mad king. In the meantime, I must ask another favor from you. It isn't anything difficult... I am asking because I am a bit tired. Can you go to the store next door and get me *one Healing Potion* and *five Antidotes*? I will finish this by the time you come back. I'm sorry to ask, but please do this for me.
