Very well. But you must first prove your worth. I'm a poor judge of character, so I don't want to see my efforts come to nothing just because you have a kind faith.

Hmm... We don't have to go far to settle this. Do you know the *Forsaken Plains*? Go there and hunt either *Yintzu or Paliote*. As proof of your victory, bring me the Monster's Shell.
