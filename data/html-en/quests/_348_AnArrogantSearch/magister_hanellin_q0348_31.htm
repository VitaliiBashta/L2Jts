Have you brought what I asked for? Please give them to me! I shall mix them together...(Gulp Gulp) Ahh~! That feels good.

My research is complete. It is as I expected. The incantation that I learned from the book of the saint and the branch of the saint I wove into the fabric that will activate the Angelic Vortex. This must be soaked in the blood of the saint, but unfortunately we don't have enough to color it completely.
