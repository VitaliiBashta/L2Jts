!Magister Hanellin:

Do you remember when I mentioned the bloodless angels? There is something I must tell you... That wasn't exactly true. When angels return to heaven, their physical bodies disappear. During this process a large amount of pure water is produced... This is known as the "blood of an angel." It cannot be contained in any vessel, it must be soaked into a piece of fabric...

And although I cannot speak their names, even to you, there are many people who would do anything to obtain the "blood of an angel".
