!Lady Claudia:

Ah! Could it be? Is that the key to the ark? You mustn't waste any time - go to the cemetery and open the bloody thing! I have no idea what is in it, just take whatever it is along with the other two sacred relics and hand them over to Magister Hanellin!

Hurry along my friend - may our next meeting take place under clearer skies!
