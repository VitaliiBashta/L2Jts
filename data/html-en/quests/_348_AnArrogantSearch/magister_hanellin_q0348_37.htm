!Magister Hanellin:

Ah, yes, I've always admired that about you.

In order for me to explain our work to you properly, I must first tell you how to access the emperor's room. First, you must disguise yourself as a member of the Platinum tribe. You still have the White Fabric I gave you, right? Soak it in the blood of *Platinum tribe shamans or overlords* and wrap it around yourself. The Angelic Vortex will let you pass.

Now, listen carefully... After soaking the cloth in blood, leave the demented Emperor where he is and come back here. There are many lives in the balance...

You shall learn more later.
