!Lady Claudia:

Have you defeated the *Guardian of the Ark* yet? No?

I've been thinking about that beast, you know, and I actually think we have some things in common. Of course, I'm hardly about to invite him round for tea and crumpets, but he knows what he stands for and has an iron will behind that remarkable strength of his. Convictions, you see, mean everything. What is a knight without a dragon to slay? What is a man without a purpose? Nothing, that's what.
