!Guard Hector:

*Stan?* He guards the *southern entrance to Oren Castle*. Should be on duty right about now, as luck would have it.

Mind you, he is known for spinning the odd tale. Once he told me he'd seen a giant rat scrambling through the castle kitchens, so we went down together, swords at the ready an' torches lit.

Only turned out to be a stray dog didn't it? Cute little thing n all, called it Bessie. Course, then it died. Jumped out a window, it did. Stupid mutt.

Anyway, enough of that. You go see Stan.
