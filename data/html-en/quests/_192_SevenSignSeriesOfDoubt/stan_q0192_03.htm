!Guard Stan:

I was out walking through the*Oren Castle* grounds a couple of nights ago. Truth be told, I was clearing my head - women problems, see?

Anyway, there I was, when it a chill creeps up my spine and everything goes deathly quiet. Suddenly this thing appears in front of me, makes some weird old sound, and... I could feel its eyes looking... looking INTO me.

Then, quick as a click, it was gone.

See... told you. It was nothing.
