!Warehouse Chief Croop:

Thank you very much. You are indeed an adventurer with a warm heart. I do have good eyes to spot a good person.

Now, you can give me Jacob's necklace. I will have someone take it to the *Town of Oren's* *High Priest Hollint in the Temple of Einhasad* beforehand.

Also, I'll send your reward for finding Jacob as well as the memorial service to High Priest Hollint. Even though I'm a dwarf, I won't be stingy in showing my appreciation for an adventurer like you.

I am sure you are tired after looking for Jacob. Have a drink of water and go see *High Priest Hollint*.

Please take care of the memorial service for Jacob for me. Well done.
