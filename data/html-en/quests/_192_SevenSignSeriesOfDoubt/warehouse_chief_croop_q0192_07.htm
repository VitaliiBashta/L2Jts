!Warehouse Chief Croop:

Ach. Look, I'm not saying you'll find Jacob face down in a ditch. I just want the boy found. If he's poured my money down his throat again then... well... he'll see.

I've found out some bits of information too. Seems *Hector* knows something about this killer, though if he's able to pull fact from fiction then he's got more knocking about that skull of his than most.

Take this letter, and go and find him at *Oren's Northern entrance*. With luck he'll set your path straight and lead you to m'cousin.
