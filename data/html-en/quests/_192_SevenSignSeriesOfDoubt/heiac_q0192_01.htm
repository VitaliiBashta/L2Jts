!Guard Hector:

Here about the murderer aren't you?

Can't blame you--I'm sure there's quite some bounty on his head, but I ain't here to aid the fear mongering that's been going on, no sir.

Besides, stay within Oren's walls and you'll be safe as houses. What's outside that pulls so many out, anyway? I swear... the folk in these parts have their heads in the clouds. They're all crusade this, save the world that....

Now, look at me. I'm happy, I'm content. Keep people safe, and sleep sound as a bear in Winter.
