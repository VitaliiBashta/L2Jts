Ha, did Hector tell you to be that vague, too? He's jumpier than a cat in a thunderstorm these days, looking for things that ain't there, and jamming two coincidences together to make conspiracies.

Yeah, maybe I saw something, and maybe it was a bit odd. Maybe I felt a pervading sense of evil shortly before seeing whatever it was, and maybe it made an unholy chattering sound as it shot off into the shadows.

But you know what? Maybe it was nothing. Thought about that?
