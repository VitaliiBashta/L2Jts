!Warehouse Chief Croop:

I want you to prepare a memorial service for m'cousin. It's a simple enough thing, and *High Priest Hollint* will be there to help you out.

Dwarves need to put into the ground fast, aye? Return their bodies to the soil, give our children's children nutrients for the farming and ore for the augmenting.

So, will ye do it? I'll be busy getting his body back here, and need a hand... if you're offering yours.
