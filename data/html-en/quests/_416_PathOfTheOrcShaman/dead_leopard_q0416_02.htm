<html><head><body>Dead Leopard's Carcass: <br> There's a strange song coming from somewhere. At last you discover the source: it issues from the mouth of a dead leopard. <br> The song sounds vaguely familiar yet somehow outlandish as well, like a song you might have heard a foreigner sing as a child.<br> <center>[. . . Zakar Gandi! Tejakar Leopa!<br> O, forgotten song, lost amid the long tribal battles!<br> O, my fellow warriors, once a mighty army, now scattered to the winds!]<br> <a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _416_PathOfTheOrcShaman dead_leopard_q0416_03.htm">Listen carefully to the song.</a></center> </body></html>
