!Soldier Tenis:

Very good! Now I can prepare one of the *trap ingredients*. I will give you one key ingredient per 100 Drake's Flesh. I will exchange it one at a time. With my injury, I'm afraid I can't do any more. But I'm your only option here. No one else has my depth of knowledge about this creature.

Do you want to continue?
