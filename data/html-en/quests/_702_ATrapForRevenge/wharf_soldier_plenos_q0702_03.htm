!Soldier Plenos:

I hoped that you would accept this challenge! You won't find a better opportunity to enhance your reputation and make a tidy pile of money.

Let's cut to the chase. Hunt the *Deadman of Destruction, Dius* that appears in the sky above the *Seed of Destruction*. It is a type of mutant Drake that has proven resistant to the power of the Seed. In fact, when the Seed is *stabilized*, it and its Drake followers have been attacking our supply and transport ships. It has become a real problem for us.

What do you say? Will you accept the mission?

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _702_ATrapForRevenge quest_accept|"Sure."]
