You really defeated him? Hee hee... Is this his horn? Ah, revenge is sweet.

It's almost as good as if I did the deed myself. Wonderful! Just looking at the horn does my heart good. Thinking about it makes me feel all warm. Hey! I'd like the horn as a souvenir, to comfort me while I recover. Would you give it to me?
