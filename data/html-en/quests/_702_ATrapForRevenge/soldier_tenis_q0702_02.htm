!Soldier Tenis:

Did you just say you want to catch *Dius, the Messenger of Destruction*? He is not your average monster, you know! You don't know what you're getting into!

Say, you're not joking, are you? All right. Well, since I'm wounded, I guess you're my only chance to get some payback. If not for that creature, I'd still be fighting with my buddies on the front lines instead of rotting away back here. If I can help you at all, I will.
