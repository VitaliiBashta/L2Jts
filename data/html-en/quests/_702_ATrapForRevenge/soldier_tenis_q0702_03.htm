!Soldier Dius:

First of all, Dius did not willingly succumb to the *Seed of Destruction*. As a result, he becomes stronger whenever the Seed becomes weaker. *Unless the Seed of Destruction becomes stable, therefore, you can't defeat him.*

Even then, you can't you can't destroy *Dius* by normal methods. He has an acute sense of smell and is very intelligent, so he rarely appears when there are a lot of people present. Instead he strikes isolated individuals when they least expect it.

But he can be defeated! You just have to lay a trap for him! When Admiral Keucereus ordered me to destroy Dius, I spent months perfecting a trap.

First, we need flesh from one of its subordinates: the *Drak, Drake Wing or mutant Drake Wing*. Collect *100 Drake's Flesh*. I need that much to prepare a single trap. Later I'll explain it more fully.
