!Solider Tenis:

Here you go. What's this? Heh heh... I squeezed the flesh you gave me. Out of it came this *rotten blood*. Then I enhanced the blood smell using my secret method. Heh -- the bloody of smell of revenge seems to be spreading even up here.

You want to know why I didn't just have you collect the blood? Well, the key is how the blood is extracted. Think about it! Blood from its own kind is used to lure it into the trap... What a sweet *trap for revenge*?

Now take this to *Engineer Lekon*. He has made many traps for me. He'll know how to make this one for Dius.
