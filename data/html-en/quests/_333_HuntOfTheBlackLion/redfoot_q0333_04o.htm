Mercenary Redfoot:<br>Shall we open the box?  This lock should be no problem for me... There we go...  That was too easy.  Now, what do we have here?<br>A broken tablet fragment?  Hmm... What are these symbols?  Could  this be a relic from ancient times?  If this were a complete tablet, it would be a very valuable historical object.

He specializes in the restoration of relics.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _333_HuntOfTheBlackLion menu_select?ask=333&reply=2">Return</a></body></html>
