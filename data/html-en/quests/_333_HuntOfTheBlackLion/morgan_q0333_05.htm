Guildsman Morgan:<br>I cannot thank you enough for recovering our stolen freight boxes. If our commercial guild was in a better financial situation, we would hire competent mercenaries like you as bodyguards...

You have earned it, please take it without refusing. <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _333_HuntOfTheBlackLion menu_select?ask=333&reply=2">Go back</a></body></html>
