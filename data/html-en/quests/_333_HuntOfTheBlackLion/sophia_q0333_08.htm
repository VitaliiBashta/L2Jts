Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br>The delu lizardmen were originally stationed by the shore area in the south of Giran.  However, lately they have been infiltrating Dion territory. We don't know what they are up to yet, whether it is to find food or to prepare for a large-scale invasion. What is clear is that they are making their movements with clear determination. We must smash their units one by one and permanently discourage them from settling down in this area.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _333_HuntOfTheBlackLion menu_select?ask=333&reply=8">"I will take on this mission."</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _333_HuntOfTheBlackLion menu_select?ask=333&reply=1">"Tell me about another mission."</a></body></html>
