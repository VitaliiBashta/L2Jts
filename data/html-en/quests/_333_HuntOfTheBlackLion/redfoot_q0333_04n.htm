Mercenary Redfoot:<br>Shall we open the box?  This lock should be no problem for me... There we go...  That was too easy.  Now, what do we have here?<br>A fragment of stone?  It appears to be a piece of a statue of the goddess Shilen. Isn't she the goddess of death? I have a bad feeling about this. If this was a complete statue, it would fetch a huge amount of money. Blacksmith Rupio can repair a broken relic like this... If you collect all the fragments of the statue and take them to him, he will restore the statue.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _333_HuntOfTheBlackLion menu_select?ask=333&reply=2">Return</a></body></html>.
