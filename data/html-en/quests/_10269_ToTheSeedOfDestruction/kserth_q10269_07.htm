!Keucereus:

This *letter of recommendation* authorizes you to be active within the Seed of Destruction. It says an adventurer like you can be trusted to take care of yourself.

Give this letter to *Sergeant Allenos* inside the Seed of Destruction. Then he'll assign you an important mission.

If you wish to move freely in Gracia, you must acquire a *Flying Transformed Object*. You can do so by completing a simple mission assigned by *Engineer Lekon*, a Dwarf located south of here. You can also purchase a Transformation Scroll from *Officer Tolonis* next to him. Now then, good luck and good hunting!
