!Keucereus:

Deliver the *letter of recommendation* I gave you to *Sergeant Allenos* inside the Seed of Destruction. Then he'll give you a small reward and assign you an important mission.

If you wish to move freely through the skies of Gracia, complete a simple mission assigned by *Engineer Lekon*, a Dwarf located south of here. You can also purchase a Transformation Scroll from *Officer Tolonis* next to him.
