Very well. When you enter the Seed of Destruction, you will be assigned to either attack or defend the Dragonkin's stronghold depending on the situation. Either way, we need your help to stabilize this area.

Whatever your mission, there will likely be *a time limit in which to complete it*.

Ah, wait! Take this with you...
