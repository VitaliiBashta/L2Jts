!Keucereus:

The Seed of Destruction, located to the west of my Alliance Base, is ruled by *Tiat*, Lord of the Dragonkin and a follower of Shilen.

She is called the wife of the *Dragon of Darkness*, and when she appeared here, the monsters in the region were transformed into the likeness of Dragonkin -- at least that's how my magicians explain it. As they gather, the Seed of Destruction grows in strength.

To enter it, you must use a *clan airship* or *transformation magic*.

Heed my advice: many of the dangers here will exceed the individual skills of even the strongest adventurer. If at all possible, you should only venture there in the company of a powerful party.

Do you understand?
