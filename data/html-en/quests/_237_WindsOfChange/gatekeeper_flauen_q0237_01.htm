!Gatekeeper Flauen:

This place - my home - has been untouched by the passage of time. But now, the winds of change have begun to blow ... even here amidst the beauty of Heine.

While change often brings with it uncertainty and even anxiety, I sense something indescribable on the wind. Something ominous. Something perhaps even deadly.

I hope these feelings of mine are wrong.
