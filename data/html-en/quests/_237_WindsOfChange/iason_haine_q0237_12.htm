Are you absolutely sure this is the right path? While I trust your judgment, I want to make sure that you aren't making this decision rashly. If your resolve is firm, then I will gladly give my support to Dr. Helvetica. What say you?

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _237_WindsOfChange reply_5|"Give me time to consider this more carefully."]
