!Gatekeeper Flauen:

While Athenia is doing all she can to thwart Dr. Helvetica's plans, the land is crying out for your assistance.

Perhaps it is the providence of Eva that you have been sent here to us. The current state of affairs cannot last.  Won't you lend a hand?  Which side you choose to support is up to you...
