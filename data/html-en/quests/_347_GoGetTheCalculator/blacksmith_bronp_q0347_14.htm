<html><head><body>Blacksmith Brunon:<BR>Hello again! Have you brought the <font 
color="LEVEL">new model Calculator</font>? I guess that was too much to hope for. 
I see that you are still investigating. <BR>Remember, there are two trade guilds 
you should talk to: the <font color="LEVEL">Silver Scale Guild</font> and the 
<font color="LEVEL">Golden Wheel Guild</font>. <BR>Please hurry and get the 
Calculator for me! </body></html>
