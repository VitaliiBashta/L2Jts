!Captain Mouen:

You ever been to the Plains of the Lizardmen? It was there that the mighty dragon Antharas was slain. They say the magic that flowed through his veins poured into the Plains and bloomed into something quite beautiful. Absolute rubbish if you ask me! The region has become sick with poison! Just ask the Leto Lizardmen.
