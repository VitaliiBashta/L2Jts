!Captain Mouen:

The poisons of the plains caused the Leto to die off, and what Leto didn't die began to... evolve, if you could call it that. They have become a new species, calling themselves the Tanta. Only I doubt poison alone could do that, so it must be magic too. The poor Leto... they had no choice in the matter.

A group of investigators were sent to look into the matter months ago. We haven't heard anything back from them, though, and my duties keep me from handling the situation personally. Could you do me a favor and talk to the Chief Investigator for me? His name is Johnny.
