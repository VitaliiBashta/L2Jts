!High Priest Raymond:

Ah, so you are the one sent by Shadow Fox....

Rumors have spread like wildfire, you know. From what we have learned, a fallen angel rebelled against Einhasad, and sought to displace her god. Fortunately, she was defeated, but unfortunately... not killed.

Now this fallen angel spends her days spreading heresy about Einhasad and our Temple in our very lands! Her blasphemies must must be stopped before more of Einhasad's loyal flock are led astray.
