!High Priest Raymond:

We intercepted a messaged sent by Elder Casian, a lifetime supporter of the *Revolutionaries of Dusk*. It appears he is attempting to render assistance to the wounded fallen angel and that... that means he must know where the creature can be found.

*Elder Casian* is rumored to be hiding somewhere in the wilderness. I want you to go there and find him, and get him to tell you where this fallen angel is so you can rid our world of her pox.

Prepare yourself both physically and mentally--although wounded, she will still be a mighty and formidable adversary. Bring me her spilt *blood* as proof of your success.
