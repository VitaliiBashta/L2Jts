!Elder Casian:

A preacher carrying the *Sealed Prophecy - Path of the God* was attacked in this wilderness by ants. He is missing, and without him we do not know how to determine the location of the angel...

Perhaps you can recover some pieces of the prophecy from the ants in the Ant Nest.

Provided, of course, that the vicious, machine-like ants leave you alone...

If you are so convinced of the rightness of your course, why not see if the gods will bless your attempt?
