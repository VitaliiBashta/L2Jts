!High Priest Raymond:

Well done! Well done indeed!

You have served Einhasad impeccably... silencing the blasphemous tongue of this sad, fallen creature was no easy task but still you handled your duties to perfection.

That fallen angel--no, devil is a better word--would undoubtedly have led many astray if had she not been stopped. You have done a great service for both our order and the people of this land... bravo!
