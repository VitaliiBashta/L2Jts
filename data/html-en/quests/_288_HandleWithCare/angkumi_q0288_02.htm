!Researcher Ankumi:

Have you ever seen Tanta Seer Ugoros? The scales on Seer Ugoros are of the highest quality of scales I have ever seen. Unfortunately, they are very hard to come by and causing a bit of strain on documenting and cataloging the different types of scales on the Lizardmen. Don't suppose you would be willing to help out, would you?
