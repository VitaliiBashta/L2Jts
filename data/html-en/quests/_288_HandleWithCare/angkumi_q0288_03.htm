!Researcher Ankumi:

Oh, one last thing before you go. There are these plants called *Abyss Weed* that grow around *Tanta Seer Ugoros*. When he eats these plants it restores him and turns his scales into armor.

*His scales are of the best quality when he has NOT eaten the abyss weed.*

If you can get me this type of scale your reward might be more than you imagine. Do we have a deal?

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _288_HandleWithCare quest_accept|Say you will acquire the scale for her.]
