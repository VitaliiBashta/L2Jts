!Hierarch Kekropus:

The more you know, the more danger you will be in. Because I deemed that only those able to protect themselves against this danger should hear this story, I deliberately chose a dangerous place like the Nornil's Cave. If you were able to enter and exit that place safely, you have proven your ability and earned the right to hear the secret.
