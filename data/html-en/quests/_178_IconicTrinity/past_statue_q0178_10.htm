??? : You must have been sent by Kekropus. Since you have found me, it will not be long before you leave this island. As you have come this far into Nornil's Cave, your physical development must be impressive...

Then, as requested by Kekropus, I will tell you some stories to assist your mental development. You will ponder these stories long after you have left the shores of this island, for they are part of your Kamael heritage. As long as you are a Kamael, you will face the ramifications of these stories again in various forms, though when and how remains a mystery...
