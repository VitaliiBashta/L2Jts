!Hierarch Kekropus:

Excellent! As a Kamael, you should know the truth of what I am about to tell you.

Seek the Statue of History within the Nornil's Cave. Know that it is more than it appears. It is a kind of terminal to allow you to communicate with another. Do this and you will discover the key to unlock the secret you seek.

To communicate with the statue, use the password: CRTR. Good luck!
