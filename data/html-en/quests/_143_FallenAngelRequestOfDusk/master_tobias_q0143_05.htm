!Grand Master Tobias:

Both the Preachers of the Wilderness and the Revolutionaries of Dusk heard the sounds of the angel crying for help.

She seems to be injured and fleeing something very powerful.

Now that we know where she is, we must offer what aid we can.

Go find *Elder Casian* in the *Wasteland* and ask him for the necessary medicine.

If you give him the Prophecy, he will be able to tell you the angel's exact location.

Then go heal her and bring me her message in an Echo Crystal.

Casian will be able to tell you more.
