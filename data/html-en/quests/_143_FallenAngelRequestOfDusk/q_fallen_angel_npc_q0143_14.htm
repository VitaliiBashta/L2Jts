!Fallen Angel:

I understand your confusion, but what I have told you is the truth... I wish I could explain it more fully to you, but I must not risk being discovered by Mother in this place or my mission will be a failure.

Perhaps we will meet again, in a different place, at a different time.

Thank you for your assistance -- I shall not forget it.

Until we meet again, may the light of heaven shine on you and through you...
