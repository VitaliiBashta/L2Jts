!Fallen Angel:

In a way, Shilen is also a victim...

Why has Mother not used her great power to restore things to their natural order?

Why has Gran Kain, that trouble-making lover of chaos, become a father figure to the gods?

Chaos and order should not be able to co-exist... And why is the goddess of order falsely idolized by the people of chaos...

I cannot understand this.

Perhaps that is why I could not become a goddess...
