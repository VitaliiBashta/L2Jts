!Elder Casian:

Yes, the prophecies seemed to predict the arrival of the fallen angel through a series of metaphors.

My knowledge is limited, but I will do my best to divine their true meaning.

In fact, if I remember correctly, the prophecies even mention that an unknown adventurer helps the angel...

By using the place mentioned in the prophecies as a clue, I believe I may be able to determine the angel's location...
