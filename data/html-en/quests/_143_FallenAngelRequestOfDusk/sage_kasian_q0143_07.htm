!Elder Casian:

Perhaps you are -- now.

But your encounter with the angel may change you...

Because the strong grow stronger and the weak become weaker, this world is waiting for a hero who is unafraid to speak truth to power and who will face the coming darkness without flinching.

Whether that is you, I cannot say. But I pray that that person appears soon -- for all our sakes.
