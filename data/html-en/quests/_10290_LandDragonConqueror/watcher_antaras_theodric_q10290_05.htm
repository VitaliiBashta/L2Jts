!Antharas Watchman Theodric:

I am a Watcher which brings the curse of immortality. My purpose in life is to watch over the earth dragon, Antharas. I can only assume that you and your comrades are here to slay the dragon.

I wish to give you some words of wisdom before you venture into this cave...

You will die.
