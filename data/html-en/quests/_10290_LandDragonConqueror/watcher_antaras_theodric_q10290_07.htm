!Antharas Watchman Theodric:

Take this *Shabby Necklace*. If you manage to strike Antharas down part of its energy will be contained in this necklace preventing it from growing any more powerful. If successful, the necklace will transform. Bring me the transformed necklace as proof of successfully stopping Antharas.

Remember, *Antharas is even more powerful than before. It will take more effort to kill it now.*

As always I will be watching...
