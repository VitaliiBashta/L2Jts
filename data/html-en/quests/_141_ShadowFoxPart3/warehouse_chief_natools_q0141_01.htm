!Warehouse Chief Natools:

Ah, you are the adventurer who wants to meet Shadow Fox!

I know your reasons already, so there's no need to justify yourself to me.

You want to know the status of our search for the angel, don't you?

I heard news from Kluck, you know.

But you must be a high-level agent to meet Shadow Fox.

Before I can fully trust you, I must ask that you carry out another mission for me.

Are you ready?
