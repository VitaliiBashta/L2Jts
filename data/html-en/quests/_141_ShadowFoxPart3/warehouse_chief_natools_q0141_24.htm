Both of these missions are very important.

Not only must they be completed quickly, they also have extensive political ramifications.

I do not think you are yet ready to take on so important a responsibility.

Perhaps with more training and experience...

(Only characters level 38 and above who have completed Shadow Fox - 3 are permitted to undertake either the Fallen Angel - Request of Dusk or the Fallen Angel - Request of Dawn quest.)
