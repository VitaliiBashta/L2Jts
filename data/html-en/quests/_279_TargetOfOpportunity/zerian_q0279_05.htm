!Jerian:

Alright, here's what you need to do. Defeat the *Cosmic Scout, Cosmic Watcher, Cosmic Priest, and Cosmic Lord*. You will pick up a *fragment of their essence* after defeating them. Assemble these parts and you will have a Seal Breaker, a stone that will allow you to travel directly to Ranku and Demon Prince by fooling the Tower's Seal into thinking you a devil.

Bring the parts to me and I can convert them. Do you wish to enter now?
