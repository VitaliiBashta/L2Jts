This would be a good time to compliment the Duke on his concern for the public treasury, but, alas, I know him too well.<br>Anyway, I'm recruiting volunteers to drive away the Tasaba lizardmen for the Duke. He will personally give out the rewards when we are successful. If you wish to volunteer, speak up now!<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _351_BlackSwan quest_accept">"I will join your effort against the Tasaba lizardmen."</a></body></html>
