Oh, thank you so much, that's really cool of you. I wish I was tough like you... or heck, even as tough as my little niece Gretzka. She's a tough little cookie. Anyway, that's not important. What is important is that you bring me samples of the plants on the Plains. I need *one bag of spores from the Fantasy Mushroom*, *one bag of spores from the Sticky Mushroom*, and *one leaf from the Energy Plant*. All of these can be found on the Plains. And this goes without saying, but don't eat them until I have a chance to study them!
