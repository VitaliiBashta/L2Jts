!Spellbook Seller Rouke:

Uh...perhaps I've said too much.

I do not know why the Temple is interested in the ancient Giants' technology.

Perhaps it is simply in order to keep it away from the traitors, or to counter its effects should it fall into the wrong hands.

How can I understand the subtle strategies of the Temple's leaders?

In any case, please pass this report to Priestess Glyvka.
