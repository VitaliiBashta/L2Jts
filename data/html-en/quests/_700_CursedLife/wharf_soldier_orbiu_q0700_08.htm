!Soldier Orbyu:

Have you finished your hunting? Then show me the remains I asked you to bring back.

Let's see...

Oh...you brought back a lot! From this, I can tell that you caught *Rok* and split its stomach open. Either that or you must have hunted a great many *Mutant Birds*and *Dra Hawks*!

Here is the reward I promised. Let me ask you, though -- are you interested in hunting more of the creatures?

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _700_CursedLife wharf_soldier_orbiu_q0700_09.htm|Say yes.]
