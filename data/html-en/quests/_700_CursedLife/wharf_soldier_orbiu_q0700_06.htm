!Soldier Orbyu:

Hurry! They appear in the skies above the *Seed of Infinity*. Hunt *Rok, Mutant Birds and Dra Hawks* and bring back *Swallowed Skulls, Swallowed Sternums and Swallowed Bones* as proof.

Remember that Rok will only emerge when the Seed of Immortiality is stabilized.

I'm counting on you!
