!War Mage Artius:

Excellent!

Then go defeat *Banshee Queen Enira* that lurks near the Seed of Infinity. You should also destroy the *Floating Zombies and Floating Skulls* that always accompany this monster. As evidence of your victory, bring back the *Banshee Queen's Eye* as well as *Skeletal Remains* from the *Floating Zombies and Floating Skulls*. I promise you that you will be rewarded for your help. But don't forget that these monsters only appear at night!
