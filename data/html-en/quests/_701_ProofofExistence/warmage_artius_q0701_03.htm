!War Mage Artius:

We think that what the soldiers saw might have been a monster called *Banshee Queen Enira*. If so, that would be a dangerous enemy. In can create fear using *Floating Zombies* and *Floating Skulls*.

Still, experienced soldiers shouldn't be reduced to a gaggle of frightened children! If I weren't needed here to safeguard the Barrier Orb, I'd go deal with this myself. Since I can't go, I need a skilled adventurer. How about it? With your ability, I'm you can handle whatever you encounter out there.
