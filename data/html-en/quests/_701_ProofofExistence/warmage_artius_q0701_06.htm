!War Mage Artius:

Ah! You're back? What's this? You couldn't defeat that vile monster? That's unfortunate, but a promise is a promise. Here's a reward for your other efforts in this matter. But you're not giving up already, are you? Please destroy *Banshee Queen Enira*! I'll also reward you for eliminating the *Floating Skulls and Floating Zombies*. Just remember, you'll have to go at night. Are you ready?
