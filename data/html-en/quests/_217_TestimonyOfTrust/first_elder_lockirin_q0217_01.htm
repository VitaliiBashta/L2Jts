First Elder Lockirin:<br>Welcome, young friend, to the House of Elders. My name is Lockirin Stonecutter. I am the Head Elder of the Bronze Door Guild, and the First Elder of the Guild Elder Association. Impressive, eh?  <br> What I actually do is humor the old goats in the Seniors Association. So, what brings you here?<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _217_TestimonyOfTrust menu_select?ask=217&reply=1">Show Seresin's letter</a></body></html>
