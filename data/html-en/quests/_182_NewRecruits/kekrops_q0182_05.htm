!Hierarch Kekropus:

Thank you. The person they should meet within the Nornil's Garden is called N. Please help us find people to accompany our youth to meet N.

N is in the deepest part of the Nornil's Garden, inside the big cavern.

If you help the youth meet N, you will also be able to speak with N, and will be shown gratitude on behalf of our race.
