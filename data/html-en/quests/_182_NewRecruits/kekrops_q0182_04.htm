!Hierarch Kekropus:

It is called the Rite of Youth -- in reality a series of tests that the young of our race must traditionally pass in order to reach maturity.

One involves entering Nornil's Garden and meeting someone within. Normally, several should go at once, but the young do not always cooperate well with each other. Should you encounter any Kamael youth, would you assist them in entering Nornil's Garden?
