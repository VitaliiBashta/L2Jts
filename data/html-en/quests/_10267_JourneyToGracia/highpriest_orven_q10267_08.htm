!High Priest Orven:

I appreciate your commitment. All of Aden will be counting on you and your comrades.

Your first challenge will be reaching Gracia. First, go to the *Gludio Airship Dock*. There you should ask the manager, *Magister Papiku*, about the journey.

Take this. It is a letter to *Keucereus*, who currently rules Gracia. It designates you as one of the Aden warriors sent to fight the evil in his land. I pray you will be able to help him...and us. May Einhasad shine her blessed light upon your path....
