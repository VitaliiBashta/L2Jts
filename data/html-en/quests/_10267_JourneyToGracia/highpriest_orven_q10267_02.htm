!High Priest Orven:

Do you know the tragedy that has befallen *Gracia*? The power of Shilen, the Goddess of Death, has manifested itself in the form of a *Seed* that has transformed the entire continent into a land of death. Despite the valiant efforts by a few lords and their warriors, most of Gracia is chaos and evil.

Now we need brave adventurers more than ever. However, I'm afraid you are not yet ready for so great a trial. Perhaps in the future...
