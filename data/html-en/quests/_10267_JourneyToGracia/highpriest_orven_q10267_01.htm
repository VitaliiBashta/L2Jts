!High Priest Orven:

Do you know the tragedy that has befallen *Gracia*? The power of Shilen, the Goddess of Death, has manifested itself in the form of a *Seed* that has transformed the entire continent into a land of death. Despite the valiant efforts by a few lords and their warriors, most of Gracia is chaos and evil.

Do you know what this means? When *Gracia has fallen completely into evil, Aden will be targeted next*. Our leaders met in what is being called the *Giran Assembly* and decided we must face this threat as a unified group. The Kamael were finally welcomed into the alliance at that time.

Now we need brave adventurers to fight this rising tide of darkness. Please help!
