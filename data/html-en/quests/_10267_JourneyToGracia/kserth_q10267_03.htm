!Keucereus:

Are you one of the soldiers from Aden? You deserve a reward simply for coming such a long way to help us.

Unfortunately, things are happening very quickly here, and I'm afraid I don't have the luxury for long conversations.

Even as we speak, monsters unlike any we've ever seen or heard of are wreaking havoc on my people. They seem to be filled with insane hatred toward all humanoids.

But if you have the *will and skill to fight them*, even these enemies can be defeated. I ask for nothing else. Nothing is more fearsome than a mighty warrior fighting in a righteous cause.

To arms! When you're ready to fight, come see me again.
