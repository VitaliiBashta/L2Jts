!High Priest Orven:

Finally, Shilen's followers used the dark ceremony they had originally intended for Aden on Gracia. They opened a door to the land of death: the Seed. Horrific monsters entered the land, further devastating it and its people.

Now we must all unite against this threat. That's why need adventurers willing and able to take this battle to the shores of Gracia.

If we fail, that evil will soon find its way here... We desperately need your help!
