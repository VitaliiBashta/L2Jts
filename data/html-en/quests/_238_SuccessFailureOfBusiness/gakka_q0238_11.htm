If I think about it, shouldn't this Magic Square be a lifeless organism even if it may be the symbol of that Purified Ceremony Hall? I think one can destroy something like this to be a spy.

But if you're really a spy from the Purified Ceremony Hall, you won't be able to destroy the *Guardian Spirit of the Magic Square* and *Evil Spirit closed in the Magic Square*, which are almost like their companions. Thus, I won't be able to doubt you anymore if you can destroy those and bring *20 broken fragments of the Guardian Spirit*.<br>Thus, please hurry and leave for the Purified Ceremony Hall!
