!Dr. Helvetica:

Although I gave you the Reed Field Development Research Certificate, I cannot trust you 100%. But if you could do this *favor* for me, I will be able to trust you completely.

If you can successfully carry this out, you not only don't have to bring along the certificate cumbersomely, but I also should be able to put you on the mission given from the base.
