According to Kier's ancient code, the only weapon that can be used against Freya is the *Divine Sword*. Unfortunately, no one knows what it is or where it might be.

Can you go to Kier's ice sculpture once more and look for something that might resemble a Divine Sword? We can't think of anywhere else a clue might be.
