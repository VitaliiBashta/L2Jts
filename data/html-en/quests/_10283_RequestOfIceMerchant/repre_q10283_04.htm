Hm... it looks like we could use you to look deeper into this.

The data you brought proved very valuable. We need to know without any doubt that we can trust you. The survival of the Jinia guild depends on nothing less.

I can tell when someone is lying to me... Look me in the eye and say you will not betray us.
