!Soldier El:

Obryu sent you? He just can't leave well enough alone.

Yes, as you can see I'm the sole survivor of that troop. Do you know what that means? I fled to save my own miserable life while my fellow soldiers were dying. I'm a coward. And we failed to accomplish *the mission*. Now every night I have nightmares about my dead friends. I should have died there...
