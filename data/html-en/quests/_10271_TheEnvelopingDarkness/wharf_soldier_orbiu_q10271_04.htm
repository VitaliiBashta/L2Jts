!Soldier Orbyu:

To the west of Keucereus Alliance Base lies a place called the *Seed of Destruction*. It is ruled by the lord of the Dragon Race.

We have sent many scouts to gather information about the Seed, but few of them ever returned. The rest were too afraid to venture deeply into the area. Obviously we cannot wage war effectively if we know so little about our enemy.

That's why we need your help to gather information about the Seed. Will you do it?
