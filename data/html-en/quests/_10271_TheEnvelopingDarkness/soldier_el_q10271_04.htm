!Soldier El:

We were sent to *protect the group dispatched to investigate the Seed of Destruction*. We were part of a large force and felt invincible. At first everything went well.

Then...we were attacked by the Mounted Troop. We kept fighting in order to complete our mission. While some of us kept up a rearguard defense, a few others tried to deliver the documents containing records of our investigation to the fortress. *Inspector Medibal* and I were ordered to deliver them. Thanks to our soldiers' efforts we were able to get out...barely. But as we were almost clear, Medibal and I were both hit. And...and I couldn't grab the *inspection documents* he was holding. I betrayed the trust of my comrades. I failed them...
