You have brought <?itemcount?> Red Stones. I wish it were more, but it looks like you have worked hard to get these. What do you want me to do with these?

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _691_MatrasSuspiciousRequest reply_3|"Give me what you promised for bringing you 744 stones."]

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _691_MatrasSuspiciousRequest reply_4|"I will go back and get some more stones."]
