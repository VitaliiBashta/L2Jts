!Priest Kanis:

Actually, a magician named *Galate* was dispatched from this Oracle's island to the Ivory Tower in nearby *Innadril.*

The Ivory Tower sensed the growing magical power near Hellbound Island, and after an investigation, it discovered that the area was connected in some way to Beleth.

The Ivory Tower entrusted *Galate* with the special mission of discovering a method for breaking Beleth's powerful magic barrier and entering Hellbound Island.
