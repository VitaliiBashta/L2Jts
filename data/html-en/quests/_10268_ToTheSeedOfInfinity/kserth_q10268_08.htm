!Keucereus:

When you enter the Seed from *the Dock of the Seed of Infinity*, you will see my subordinate, *Officer Tepios* at a place called the *Death Gate*. Give him this letter of recommendation.

To enter the Seed of Infinity, remember that you'll first need to *teleport there through a person named Jaedin* at the *Dock of the Seed of Infinity*.


You must also acquire a *Flying Transformed Object* in order to move through the skies of Gracia. You can do so by completing a simple mission assigned by *Engineer Lekon*, a Dwarf located south of here or by purchasing a Transformation Scroll from *Officer Tolonis* next to him.
