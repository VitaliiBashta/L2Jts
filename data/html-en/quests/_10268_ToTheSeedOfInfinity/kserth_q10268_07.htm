!Keucereus:

Take this *letter of introduction*, which authorizes you to engage in action within the Seed of Infinity. It is a dangerous region, but this letter says that an adventurer like you can be trusted to carry out missions there.

Deliver this letter to *Officer Tepios* inside the Seed of Infinity and he will understand why I have recommended you.

Be advised that first you must be *teleported inside the Seed of Infinity by a person called Jaedin*, who you will find at the *Seed of Infinity Dock*.

First, you must acquire a *Flying Transformation* ability. This is needed in order to venture into the skies of Gracia. You may obtain this by completing a simple mission assigned by *Engineer Lekon*, a Dwarf located south of here. Alternately, you can purchase a Transformation Scroll from *Officer Tolonis* in the same place. Farewell and good luck!
