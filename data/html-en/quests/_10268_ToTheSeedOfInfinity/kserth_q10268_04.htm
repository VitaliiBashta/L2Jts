!Keucereus:

The Seed of Destruction, located to the north of my Alliance Base, is a land of death governed by *Ekimus*, the Lord of the Dead and a devout follower of Shilen.

It is inhabited by the undead. The surrounding land has also been contaminated, so the only safe way to approach it is by air, either in a *clan airship* or via *transformation magic*.

Heed my advice: many of the dangers here will exceed the individual skills of even the strongest adventurer. If at all possible, you should only venture there in the company of a powerful party.

Do you understand?
