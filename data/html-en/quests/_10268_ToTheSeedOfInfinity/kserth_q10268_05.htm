!Keucereus:

Then I'll tell you about the mission. When you enter the Seed of Infinity region, you'll be given either an attack order against Seed of Infinity's undead army or a defense order. If you wish, join the mission.

Because it is so dangerous, though, you are restricted to *only 1 enlistment per day*, but you'll be generously rewarded for success.

Now take this letter of recommendation.
