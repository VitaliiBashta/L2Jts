!Guard Pinaps:

I carefully inspected the Training Log and Schedule of the Sel Mahums, which you brought it last time. It looks like they are getting trained more systematically than I expected. I guess just finding out the information isn't enough...

If their power gets stronger through this training, it will be a huge threat to this village. Wouldn't you want to help me to stop their training?
