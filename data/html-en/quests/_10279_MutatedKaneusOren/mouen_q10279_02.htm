<html><head><body>Captain Mouen:<br>Ah, it's you! Magister Rovia asked me to convey her gratitude to you. She said that the cellular tissues of the mutated Kaneus from the <font color="LEVEL">Kamaloka of Oren</font> that you delivered to the Sages of Magic were a great help.<br>She has sung your praises throughout the entire territory, in fact! But if you have no more business here in Dion, I'd suggest that you go to the <font color="LEVEL">Kamaloka of Schuttgart</font>. I am sure somebody there is in need of your help as well. Farewell, my friend!</body></html>
