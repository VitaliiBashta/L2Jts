!Priestess Pupina:

Those hypocrital Temple priests pray, study, heal and give money to charity, to be sure -- but they refuse to risk dirtying their robes by actual venturing out among the poor and downtrodden.

If you can show that you do not share their aloofness, I will write you a letter of recommendation that you may give to Preacher Sla.
