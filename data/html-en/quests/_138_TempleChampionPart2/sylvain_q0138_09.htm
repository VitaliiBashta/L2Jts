!High Priest Sylvain:

We have commissioned Shadow Fox, the information dealer, to gather information about the angel from his sources...

I dislike the secrecy associated with using an outsider like that, but I accept the need for it at this delicate juncture.

If you wish to help search for the angel, contact Shadow Fox.

He will not reveal himself directly, so you should *ask Warehouse Keeper Mia in Heine how to contact Shadow Fox*...

She has already told him that an experienced adventurer would be an asset in the search.

Tell Warehouse Keeper Mia that I sent you and she should speed you on your way to Shadow Fox.

You have served us well in this matter. May Einhasad guard you on your journey!
