!Grand Master Angus:

(Angus looks very sad...)

Hmm...

You wish to help me?

Well then... One of the Dark Elven trainees was accidentally killed during an actual fighting drill in Death Pass.

I am preparing a ritual that will permit his soul to return to Shilen in peace.

I do this in accord with the customs of his people...

To perform the ritual, however, we will need his belongings, which were lost in Death Pass.

You belong to the Temple of Einhasad, do you not?

Are you sure that you wish to provide aid to a follower of Shilen?
