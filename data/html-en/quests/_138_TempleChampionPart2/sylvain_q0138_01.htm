!High Priest Sylvain:

Ah, the Limbs of the Temple...

...

We wish to distribute our manifesto -- which argues that the advent of the angel proves the Temple's legitimacy and authority -- to the various breakaway groups.

This will give them a final chance to repent of their apostasy and return to our loving fold, and in so doing escape eternal punishment.

But it will be very difficult to disseminate the manifesto to each group -- many lie in dangerous areas and many more will suspect a trick and refuse to meet with any representative we send...

However, an experienced adventurer might be able to both reach these groups and convince them to hear him out.

Will you help us?
