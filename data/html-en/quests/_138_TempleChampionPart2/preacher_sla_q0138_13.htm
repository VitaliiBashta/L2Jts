Don't lose your faith in the goddess. Regardless of race or rank, Einhasad's light and healing magic is still very much present in our world.

I do not know what happened between Einhasad and Emperor Shunaiman, but...

It is my belief that it is not the goddess who is at fault for the misfortunes that have befallen her people; it is rather the fault of those who exploit her name for their own power and advancement.

Go tell *High Priest Sylvain* what I just told you.
