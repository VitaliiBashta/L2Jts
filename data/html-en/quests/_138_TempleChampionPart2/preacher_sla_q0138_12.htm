!Preacher Sla:

I can see you're confused...

That's understandable, but take care that you don't lose faith! Remember that the healing power of Einhasad is everywhere, regardless of rank or race.

I don't know what happened between Einhasad and Emperor Shunaiman, but...

I refuse to believe that the goddess is somehow in error -- it must be those mortals who pervert her good name for their own advancement that are to blame.

Now go tell *High Priest Sylvain* what I just told you!
