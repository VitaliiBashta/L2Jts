!Priestess Pupina:

*Grand Master Angus in the Town of Giran* is charged with the raising of Dark Elves.

We have heard word that one of the Dark Elven trainees was involved in a serious accident.

I think Angus may need help to deal with it. I will ask him for more information, but I must warn you that in rendering him aid you will almost certainly be violating the rules of your order.

Angus knows Preacher Sla well, however, and if you help him I am sure that he will write a letter of recommendation on your behalf.

Knowing that you may be asked to break the Temple code, do you still want to undertake this task?

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _138_TempleChampionPart2 reply_4|"I cannot. I must abide by the rules of the Temple in all things."]

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _138_TempleChampionPart2 reply_5|"I believe that Einhasad prefers mercy to blind obedience. I will certainly help if I can."]
