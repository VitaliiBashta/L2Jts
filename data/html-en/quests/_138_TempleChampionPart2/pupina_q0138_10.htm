!Priestess Pupina:

Ah, I see you have brought me a letter from Angus...

Let me see...

Hmm...according to this, you assisted in a ritual to Shilen, whom Einhasad imprisoned long ago. There can be no doubt that you have violated the rules of the Temple in this matter -- and gravely.

As an adventurer all too familiar with death, Angus' sorrow touched me, as did his desire to lay the trainee's soul to rest. What I did in no way helped Shilen, but it did give a measure of peace to the dead man's friends. I would hope they would do the same for me."]
