!Grand Master Angus:

You have returned with all of his belongings! Shilen be praised!

Thanks to your help, we will be able to send the soul of the dead Dark Elven trainee to rest with Shilen.

We are in your debt.

I will write you a letter of recommendation so that others of my faith will not treat you like one of those arrogant priests of the Temple of Einhasad.
