!High Priest Sylvain:

(Tell him that you met Preacher Sla and gave her the manifesto, and have returned with a message from her.)

Only a strong and unified Temple can bring peace to this continent, and only concentrated power can protect the people.

Besides, the angel of Einhasad has obviously come down to empower us in our holy mission. What else would it mean?

But even with this clear evidence, I see they will not accept the truth. I just do not understand them...

We are now attempting to determine the angel's exact whereabouts.

Once we contact the angel, surely even the apostates must accept our authority.
