!Preacher Sla:

Since the beginning, the Temple has been deeply involved in politics, even as it continues to stubbornly insist on its divine legitimacy.

But look closer at this manifesto...

The possible presence of the angel here could either support their claims or be their ruin.

What if the angel offers a glimpse of the divine that is vastly different that what the Temple has maintained is the truth?

Its entire foundation will collapse...

The only way to be sure, of course, is to find this angel and learn why he has come...
