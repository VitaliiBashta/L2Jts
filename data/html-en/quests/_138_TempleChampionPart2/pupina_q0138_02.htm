!Priestess Pupina:

Greetings, adventurer who carries out the mission of the Temple!

Do you wish to meet Preacher Sla?

As you know, the preachers' goals differ somewhat from the goals of the Temple priests.

Preachers believe that the Temple's rigid rules and ceremonies often serve as a barrier to a true understanding of and relationship with the goddess.

And given the Temple's close association with the aristocracy, many preachers are critical that the priests are more concerned with personal status and wealth than true service.
