!High Priest Sylvain:

Thanks to your efforts, we were able to recreate the missing inspector's report.

Based on his findings, we have written a manifesto showing that the advent of the angel proves the authority and legitimacy of the Temple.

We wish to distribute this document to the groups who have broken ties with us.

If you give this to Preacher Sla, he will be able to disseminate it to those groups.

But...
