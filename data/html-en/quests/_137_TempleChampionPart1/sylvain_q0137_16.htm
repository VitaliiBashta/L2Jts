Hmm... This is unbelievable...

The signs reported by many of our brethren signify the advent of an angel!

Our man was investigating when and where the angel would come down to earth.

Apparently, he found an eyewitness who claims to have actually seen the angel...

If true, this means that Einhasad may be sending us another message, just as she did to Emperor Shunaiman long ago...
