!High Priest Sylvain:

How should political and military power, currently fragmented throughout this chaotic continent, best be concentrated and used?

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _137_TempleChampionPart1 reply_2|"The power should be focused through the adventurers."]

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _137_TempleChampionPart1 reply_2|"The power should be balanced by distributing it among the various races."]

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _137_TempleChampionPart1 reply_6|"The Temple of Einhasad should be the center of all power."]

[npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent _137_TempleChampionPart1 reply_2|"The power should be used according to the will of all the people: peasants, lords and adventurers."]
