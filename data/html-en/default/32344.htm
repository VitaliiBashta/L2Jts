Spooky Tombstone:

You see arcane symbols and intricate patterns engraved on the tombstone, which seems to radiate magical power. Between the symbols are carved 5 deep grooves, each of which looks just wide enough to insert a small disc. Interestingly, each groove is lined with a different metal: tin, lead, iron, copper and white gold.
