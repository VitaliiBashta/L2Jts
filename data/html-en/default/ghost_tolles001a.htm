Old Dwarven Ghost:

I was...enticed by those devils...and built this castle for them...but their greed did not stop there... They stole my soul and made me their slave forever...

The body you just destroyed...was only a shell... This castle and I have become one... I cannot die even if I want to...

My soul is watched by Darion...who resides atop this tower... Please destroy him...so that I... can finally rest in peace...
