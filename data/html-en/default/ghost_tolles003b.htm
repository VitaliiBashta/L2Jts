Old Dwarven Ghost:

One existence in Core Naia... a collective body of numerous nature spirits... Its name is... Epidos...

It creates small creatures...

When you see...a strange creature in the room...do not kill it...unless you can withstand the fury of Epidos...

(Before facing the Raid Boss Epidos, it is recommended you have a party of at least 27 characters. Epidos possesses water, fire, wind and earth attributes.)
