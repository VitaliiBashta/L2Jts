Old Dwarven Ghost:

Thank the gods... Finally someone willing to help me...

I will send you...up the stairs of this tower... That is all I can do for now...

You will encounter powerful devils...who will try your strength...

But unintentionally... some of the devils...may be of help to you...

Watch out... and increase your strength...in order to survive in this tower...
