Old Dwarven Ghost:

The room behind me is...a storage area for magical energy...extracted by Beleth...from Hellbound Isle... It is Core Naia...

Nature spirits...that once inhabited... the air, the earth and even living things...were trapped in this place for a long, long time... They mutated...as they tried to...escape.

They still possess their elemental nature...fire, water, wind and earth...and they exist separately...

But they are now interconnected... When they sense danger...they join together in...a powerful spiritual body...

They are extremely powerful now...difficult to defeat...
