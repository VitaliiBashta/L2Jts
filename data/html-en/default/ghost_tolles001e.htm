Old Dwarven Ghost:

The Tombstone is...a complicated 5-stage mechanism... It has a built-in...safety lock device... To release the device, you need each key... You need 5 small metal medals.

Those medals...can be found...somewhere in this maze...

The medal's unique owner recognition device won't allow one person to have more than one medal...so don't go looking for the medals...by yourself...
