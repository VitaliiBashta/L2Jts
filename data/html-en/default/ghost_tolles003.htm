Old Dwarven Ghost:

You're here...

Dark magic was forced in...and is slowly rotting this place...within the Tower... It has altered it...from my original design... I wish I could help you... I knew you would come here...after overcoming the barriers...

But you cannot relax yet... The most formidable obstacle still awaits you... Before you face the final trial...listen to this old man's advice, I pray...
