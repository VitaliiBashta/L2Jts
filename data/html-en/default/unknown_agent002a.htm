It is obvious that only the strongest lords should govern this citadel.

Although they have already humbled the devils who previously ruled this tower, there is one more obstacle to their victory: that arrogant beast called Darion, Beleth's chief lackey.

Well...heh heh...perhaps just one of the lords...
