Heart of Warding:

You are overcome by a voice, a voice so powerful you are helpless as it speaks:

<font color="LEVEL">You seek death and defeat by coming here without your leader! You appear before Shilen's authority

and you tempt Shilen's wrath! </font><br>(The players who belong to an association can only enter through the Association Leader.)
