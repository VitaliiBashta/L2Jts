Trader Varanket:<br>Welcome to our store! You won't be disappointed. Our items are made in cooperation with Oren's famous Ivory Tower, as well as the Dwarven Breath of Flame guild, renowned for the quality of its craftsmanship. My sister is a bit talkative, though, so we were wise to come to me.<br>
