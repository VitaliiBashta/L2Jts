Trader Rouge: <br>Nice to meet you! I'm Rouge, the owner of this shop. Oh my, you're badly sunburned. Oh, no...sorry to stare. I just sympathize with adventurers who lack quality accessories and end up weatherbeaten and old before their time. Here, have a look! Wearing any of our shop's accessories will make you look young, rich and very fetching. <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1&reply=0">Buy.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1&reply=4">Buy Common Items.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></body></html>
