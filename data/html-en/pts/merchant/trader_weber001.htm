Trader Weber: <br>A dye's power is like a devil's blessing!  While it gives you strong power, it takes away another power from you!  In order to become more powerful, you must make a sacrifice,  especially for an indispensable item! <br> I personally guarantee the quality of the dyes sold here!  I'm the most trusted dye dealer in the entire kingdom!  <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1&reply=0">Buy Dye </a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1&reply=1">Buy Consumables </a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate </a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest </a></body></html>
