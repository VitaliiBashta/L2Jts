Spellbook Seller Burns:<br>Welcome. I am Spellbook Seller Burns. <br>Hahaha! You must be surprised to find a specialized seller in the countryside like this. This Hunter's Village is rather out of the way, but there are so few places where one can experience the mysterious power of magic as one can in this place. There are magicians wherever you go in this vast world, so shouldn't there also be those who sell their tomes?! Now then, which spellbook should I show you?<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1&reply=0">Trade</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">View information about the lord and tax rate</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a><br></body></html>
