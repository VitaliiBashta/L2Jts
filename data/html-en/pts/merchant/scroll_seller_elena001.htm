Spellbook Seller Elena:<br>Good to see you. My name is Elena. I deal in old tomes and spellbooks. For me, books are the safeguards of civilization. Without them, the world would be filled only with savagery and ignorance. I shudder to even imagine such a place...<br>It is said that many so-called "heretical" books were burned in the Empire's final years. To burn a book just because you don't agree with it... In my mind, any empire like that deserved to come to an end.<br>Of course, now that people can learn spells without a spellbook, we might become obsolete after all. If that happens, perhaps I can work as a librarian at the Ivory Tower or Rune Library.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
