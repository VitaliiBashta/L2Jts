Filled with Beleth's failed experiments, it is exceedingly dangerous even for seasoned adventurers. How could Beleth create such a hellish place -- even the caravans avoid it! That said, the magical spirits that can be captured there are in great demand among the magicians of the Ivory Tower. If you can obtain some, it will also be a great help to the natives.</body></html>
