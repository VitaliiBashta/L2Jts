Fishing Guild Member Hilgendorf:<br>Welcome, my young friend! Nice to mee you! It's a great day to go fishing! <br>My family have been members of the fishing guild since my great-grandfather joined. In fact, that's why I was sent here to Rune. Not only is the fishing particularly challenging here, but it's become something of a hobby among the elite. <br><a action="bypass -h action_show_html pts/html_item/fishing_manual001.htm">Ask how to fish.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-404&reply=1">Fishing Contest</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_FishingSkillList">Learn fishing skill.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1&reply=0">Buy/Sell/Refund.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Multisell 009">Sell fish.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">View information about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
