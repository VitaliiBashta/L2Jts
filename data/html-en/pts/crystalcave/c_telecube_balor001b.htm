A dim five-colored light shines forth from an aquamarine sphere, gradually growing brighter. You hear whispers in the air around you.<br>
You have defeated it! You have done it! Did you obtain the crystal? Once again, the Oracle's premonitions have become reality...<br>
I am the third child of the Oracle, destined to gather the power of the three crystals retrieved from the Demons and open the gate to their chief.<br>
The collected crystals...just these? However, you have at least obtained the Clear Crystal. It is very special, and it can lead you to the hidden area by itself. Doing so, however, will cause the crystal to break...<br>
Do you wish to visit the hidden place? It used to be an old underground prison, which is all I know. about it. If you are reluctant to break the crystal to do so, I can also send you back to your world.<br>
