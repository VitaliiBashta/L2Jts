A small multi-colored light can be seen dancing within the orb. You hear a whispering voice.<br>
"You... you killed him! Defeated him! You've obtained the crystal, then? Another oracle fulfilled!"<br>
"Adventurer, I am the oracle's third child. I am the wielder of the three crystals: the <font color="LEVEL">blue crystal</font>, the <font color="LEVEL">red crystal</font>, and the <font color="LEVEL">clear crystal</font> that were obtained from the demons to discern the path to their leader. You must have crystals with you. You must show them to me now.<br>
If you have collected all three, I can call upon their strength, and in accordance with the final oracle, take you to <font color="LEVEL">Balor</font>, the head demon that watches over this island."<br1>"If you waver in your commitment, I will send you back to the outside world."<br>
