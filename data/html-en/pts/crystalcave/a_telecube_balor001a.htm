A dim five-colored light shines forth from an aquamarine sphere, gradually growing brighter. You hear whispers in the air around you.<br>
You have defeated it! You have done it! Did you obtain the crystal? Once again, the Oracle's premonitions have become reality...<br>
I am the third child of the Oracle, destined to gather the power of the three crystals retrieved from the Demons: the <font color="LEVEL">Blue Crystal</font>, the <font color="LEVEL">Red Crystal</font>, and the <font color="LEVEL">Translucent Crystal</font>. I open the gate to their Prince.<br>
The collected crystals...just these? Not enough... I must have the others if you wish me to help you.<br1>I shall send you back to your world.<br>
