A brilliant five-colored light shines forth from a aquamarine sphere. You hear a loud, clear voice:<br>
Welcome, you who have accomplished the test of the Oracle. Your contributions have led to the downfall of the Demon Balor.<br1>I have come here as the final command of the Oracle, but Parme has already left this place. This will not hinder your great deeds, and the day shall soon come when evil disappears from Isle of Prayer forever.<br>
I shall send you back to the outer world, so you may rest. Give me your hand when you are ready.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_request_exit">Move to Isle of Prayer.</a>
