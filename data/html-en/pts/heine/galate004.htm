Beleth was a powerful sorcerer who disappeared a thousand years ago. He was a master of the arcane arts, but his soul was as black as the abyss. It is rumored that he did not die, but made himself immortal through his dark magic.<br>
You have been to Gludio, I presume? Then perhaps you have you heard how the southern wilderness came into being because of Beleth? That, my friend, is another long story...<br>
For Kanis' sake, are you willing to help me?<br>
