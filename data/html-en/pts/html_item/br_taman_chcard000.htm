<br> <br> <font color="LEVEL">Saga Chapter #3 Sword and Shield</font> <br><br>I like armor. I like a well-polished sword, like this one here. Glints in the sun, cleaves things with a flick of a wrist. I look after it, it looks after me. Symbiosis.<br>This sword hasn't just been nurtered differently though: its very nature is different. Its hilt warms to my hand and turns cold in others'. I swear the blade has stretched out too, when my enemy has been just out of reach. But this sword was made by a simple human and not a skilled Dwarf? It has quite the story....<br><br>I remember when I found this weapon. I'd been beaten, bruised, bloodied. I had run for hours, maybe half a day, escaping from monsters twice my size. Then it happened. A burning red flash, I fell, tumbled, and awoke next to a small meandering stream.<br><br>I gathered my senses as best I could, and found something glinting at me. It was a full sword, a beautiful weapon of war, that had smashed into three shards of artisan steel. I waited for my strength to recover, then, realizing its potential, took it with me and headed up into the mountains to find shelter. It there that I found him. The swordsmith.<br><br>He was an artisan who dabbled in alchemy in his younger years, and so when he turned to blacksmithing he was able to use his metallurgy skills to good effect. He would practice day and night, perfecting his skills until his name was renowned throughout Aden. But that was... decades ago. After disappearing into distant mountains so long ago the young man's name had all but disappeared in conversation. He was more a whisper now, a legend that was spoken of rarely, and who's existence could only be proven by the few swords left that still bore his name.<br><br>Why did I decide then to look for him? I do not know, but this weapon was too special to leave, and too unique to entrust to any old anvil owning pleb. So I went into the mountains, and I found him. I found the legend, a man who had grown old and tired in this cold, inhospitable place. At first he showed fear and anger, perhaps worried that I had come to demand his services. The fear passed though, eventually replaced with warmth and a generosity that I had never seen before. He sheltered me, fed me, bandaged my wounds, and repaired the sword. A week passed before I was well enough to leave, and by that time a new question had burning bright in my mind... "Where am I?"<br><br>I remembered fighting alongside Kaurin against the Lizardmen. Then, there was that blinding light, and then... I was here.<br><br>"Kaurin...."<br>I hope he's well. I sat down, sharpening my new blade and watching the setting sun, when sounds broke from the forest. Someone was running....<br><br><font color="LEVEL">Continued in the Heintz character card</font><br><br><br>
