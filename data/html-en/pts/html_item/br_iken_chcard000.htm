<br> <br> <font color="LEVEL">Side Chapter #1</font> <br><br>"What?! Really?" Iken shouted out, right in the middle of the Talking Island village square. But this was no time for silence - he could really become a knight! A knight in shining armor with a sword in one hand and a shield in the other... A brave knight who protects the people behind him.... He puffed up with pride... it had always been Iken's dream to become a knight. The only problem, of course, was that no one ever had ever told him how exactly to go about becoming a knight....<br>He would travel out regardless, fighting monsters and saving villagers and all that, when one day he met a beautiful Elf around the ancient Elven Relics. They were out adventuring together when the Elf casually told him that he could become a knight whenever he wanted.<br><br>"Iken, you're already qualified enough to become a knight! You should pass the apprentice knight test without any problems." Iken was amazed.<br>"There... there's a test for becoming a knight?" The Elf giggled, nodding slightly.<br>"Hoo! You really don't know anything about it? You have to take the apprentice knight test in Gludin Village." Iken flashed a smile, and darted back home as fast as he could.<br>.<br>.<br>That evening, Iken gazed up at the stars, his excited eyes joining dots together and making patterns in the night sky. He didn't get one wink of sleep.<br>Oh... to become a knight! During lunch the following day, he promised the kind and gentle Elf that they would take a boat together to Gludin Village. Riding a boat, becoming a knight! Oh the adventure! Iken was also worried a little bit about seasickness, he had never been on a boat after all. There was also that mysterious male Elf whom he had met yesterday. Why did he disappear from the Elven Relics without saying anything? Iken frowned for a moment... what had happened to him? What if he was hurt? Maybe they should look for... "I'M GOING TO BE A KNIGHT! Woohoo!"<br><br><font color="LEVEL">Continued in the Orodriel character card</font><br><br><br>
