<html><head><body>Record of the Mother Tree Guardian:<br>Panacea was a product of just such a guardian's ritual. He trained long and hard in martial arts techniques that allowed him to block all distractions from his mind.
<br>However, the ritual is impenetrable in only one aspect, and leaves another aspect quite vulnerable. Elven defenses can be overcome by psychological attacks such as Hate, but beware the guardian's swordsmanship.<br>The very fact that he was selected as a Mother Tree Guardian is evidence of his superiority.<br>Use skills such as Ultimate Defense against him.
