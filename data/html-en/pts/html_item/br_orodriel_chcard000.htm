<br> <br> <font color="LEVEL">Side Chapter #2</font> <br><br>Orodriel enjoyed traveling. She had arrived at the secluded village on Talking Island via towns here and there exactly one year ago, and all to see that one little place.... You see, near the village there was a legendary tourist site known as the Elven Relics. Legend had it that it had been built long ago under the careful guidance of Queen Marilion herself. Orodriel was walking quietly through the ruins, running nimble fingertips along ancient stone when she bumped into a strange fellow.<br><br>"Hi! I'm Iken! There are horrible, horrible monsters around here, so be careful! Maybe I should protect you, hmm?!"<br><br>She found the man a bit of a fool, but sweet, and agreed to form a party with him. Together they explored through the nearby areas where they found glistening waterfalls and beautiful vistas, a paradise far from Aden's war-torn fields.<br><br>During their little expedition, the two got talking. Iken told Orodriel of his desire to become a knight. She responded in turn by telling Iken of the apprentice knight test at Gludin Village. Iken's eyes lit up like lanterns at sunset, and it was agreed there and then. They were to go to Gludin; Iken was to become a knight.<br><br>"I'll pay your fare, Iken. You've brought more warmth to my heart than I've felt in quite some time. The least I could do is pay for your passage to Gludin." Iken smiled broadly. Both broke into unhinged laughter.<br><br>Orodriel didn't have many friends: she had always worked alone, travelled alone, lived alone. The company she had kept was mostly Elven, and each stuck to their Elven ways like bees on Spring flowerbuds. This Iken was something else. He was full of life, of joy, a bounding, irresistible panacea for everything that Orodriel had become accustomed to. She wanted to see the world outside of her natural habitat, to roam around the vast lands of Aden.<br><br>The two made their way to Gludin, unaware of the events that were about to unfold....<br><br><font color="LEVEL">Continued in the Gnosian character card</font><br><br><br>
