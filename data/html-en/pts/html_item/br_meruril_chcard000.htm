<br> <br> <font color="LEVEL">Saga Chapter #5 The Lord's Request</font> <br><br>"Oh, it's so cute!! It's adorable!"<br>Meruril was having a wonderful time in the market. The streets were lined with new things she'd never seen before, toys and gadgets that made her eyes widen like flower buds in Spring. <br>"Now THAT looks delicious!" Said Lanya, the small girl beside her. She was having a ball of a time too, eyeing the countless pastries and sweets being sold on the far side of the street.<br>The marketfolk had spied the two Elves, and tracked them with curious eyes as they wandered through the bustling streets. Their pointed ears and extraordinary height more than enough reason to pique the interests of passing villagers.<br>"What are you looking at?" The male Dark Elf finally snapped, his tempers flared by one particularly curious child.<br><br>A few days ago, the two Dark Elves Lakinos and Mortia had been sent out to investigate reports of a red shining stone on Black Stone Hill. They found the stone in question, but just as they were ready to retrieve it a bright flash engulfed them and delivered them to this place.<br>They were first discovered by the Lord's personal guards, good men who brought the two to their Lord. He realized straight away that they had something to do with the Red Dimensional Stone, so asked Lakinos and Mortia to investigate the destruction being caused by the monsters that had also just recently appeared. Lakinos and Mortia split up and investigated on their own, one travelling east, the other west. Lakinos returned first, and brought back to the Lord a human male, human female, Dwarven female, Elven male, Elven female, and an Orc female who had also come from the world of Aden through the stone.<br><br>As they drew closer to the Lord's castle, they realized the sheer size and beauty of the place. It was easily as large as Oren Castle, but was much more magnificent and exquisite, with rows of armored guards standing by the grand main gate. <br>Lakinos gestured to the guards at the entrance, and the old gate creaked open. The band of strangers entered, following the guide through the labyrinth-like pathways inside the castle walls.<br><br><font color="LEVEL">Continued in the Lakinos character card</font><br><br><br>
