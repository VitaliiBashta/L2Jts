<br> <br> <font color="LEVEL">Side Chapter #5</font> <br><br>"Hmm... so that's how I ended up here?" Kaurin's mind was tired. A Red Dimensional Stone. That was what gathered everyone here, triggered apparently when Gnosian approached it.<br><br>"There is a way back." Gnosian spoke, his voice echoing off the dry, stark walls. The Dwarf, Meruril was the next to speak.<br><br>"How? What should we do?"<br><br>"We need to gather all the small broken pieces of the Red Dimensional Stone back together. That should open the door for our passage back." The six had been sitting around their bonfire, telling each other stories and talking about their experiences and outlooks. But now... now they had a purpose. All they had to do was find the stone.<br><br>"How do we find the fragments?" Kaurin asked, his face lit flickering flame.<br><br>"The stone probably came into this world with someone... or something. If we find them... it... we should find the fragments." The female Elf turned to Gnosian.<br><br>"I assume you're referring to monsters of some kind?"<br><br>"I am. The Red Dimensional Stone was scattered throughout the Aden continent, most likely by monsters. There were at least a few hundred that came just with me, so I can only guess at their total number..." Gnosian stopped for a moment, tapping his temple as he thought.<br><br>"And the Red Dimensional Stone seems to lure in creatures. As I recall, when the big Red Dimensional Stone shattered, the monsters that had been hunting me turned tail and headed straight to the fragments." Gnosian stopped again, piecing together memories as best he could, trying to work out a plan. The female Dwarf spoke again.<br><br>"Then... if we find the monsters, we'll find the fragments?" Gnosian nodded.<br><br>"I believe so. At least, that seems likely." Iken jumped up, as full of energy and passion as ever.<br><br>"Then let's go!"<br><br>"But... before you do that, don't you need to know where the monsters are?" The sharp voice sounded from the darkness. All six picked up their weapons and jumped to their feet. Slow footsteps, a shape appeared in the night's darkness.<br><br>"If you want to find the Red Dimensional Stone, follow me."<br><br>The figure stepped forward again, and in the light the others could make out his dark complexion and pointed skin - it was a Dark Elf!<br><br><font color="LEVEL">Side Chapters Complete<br><br></font><font color="LEVEL">Saga Chapters begin with the Naonin Character Card</font><br><br><br>
