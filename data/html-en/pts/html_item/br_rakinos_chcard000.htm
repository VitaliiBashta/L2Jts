<br> <br> <font color="LEVEL">Saga Chapter #6 Reunion</font> <br><br>If the castle exterior had caught the strangers' attention, the interior took the breath away. The halls bristled with vibrant color, decorated with art that they had never seen anywhere in Aden, and the polished floors were covered in rugs so exquisite that most stepped around them, afraid of spoiling them with their muddied boots. One of the servants led them all to a large room where they were served tea and snacks, treated with airs and graces that were simply alien to most of them. Ten minutes passed when familiar voices were heard outside the door. <br><br>"This castle is itself a work of art, oh aye!"<br>"You are correct, Dwarf."<br>The latter's voice was a deep growl, one that Kaurin, the female Orc, recognized instantly.<br><br>"Taman!" They were her first words. She bolted up and heaved the door open to find Taman Zu Rapatui standing there. The huge Orc's eyes widened, and the two embraced without saying a word. Eventually their holds weakened, and the two looked at each other earnestly, their eyes glistening with excitement.<br>"You're alive!"<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Mortia entered, her eyes studying the group for a moment before she spoke. "He's ready to see you now."<br>The Lord greeted the group in strange, alien words. Gnosian stepped forward and tried to communicate on behalf of the others.<br><br>"It seems that monsters have been appearing all over the Lord's lands. They've already killed a number of the travelling merchants... and now are waiting outside one of the villages." The Kamael woman stepped forward, her face etched with anger.<br>"Monsters? What does he mean?" Gnosian raised his finger. The Lord spoke again.<br>"The Lord wants our help in defeating the monsters. He believes that we were sent here for that task and that... our angel... was sent here to save his people. Angel?" Kaurin spoke again.<br>"What do we know about the monsters? Does the Lord have some kind of plan?" Gnosian nodded.<br>"There are around 300 creatures. The Lord doesn't care how they're dealt with, as long as they are destroyed. He has some scouting reports here - it seems the monsters vary in type: some fly while some can only crawl. They are currently based at the foot of the mountain and seem to be mobilizing for an attack this evening. We...." The Lord beckoned Gnosian to wait for a moment.<br><br>The doors to the room swung open, and servant and after servant entered bearing weapons and armor until there was a glittering pile in the center of the room. The servants left, only to return moments later with further treasures; they brought all kinds of ornaments and brilliant clothes, gold, silver, and laid them down before the party.<br><br>Meruril's eyes widened when she saw all the bright-colored silk clothes. "These are for us?" She asked, her voice trembling with excitement.<br>"As I was about to say, the Lord said we would be rewarded well." Gnosian pointed to the treasures in the room.<br><br>"We just need to survive the fight...."<br><br><font color="LEVEL">Continued in the Mortia character card</font><br><br><br>
