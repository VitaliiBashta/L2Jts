<font color="LEVEL">Side Chapter #4</font> <br><br>The girl stared absent-mindedly at the sky, imagining all sorts of shapes in the clouds above. <br>
There was the little cottage she grew up in, there was a girl dancing, and over there, A DINOSAUR! <br>
There was something even more exciting coming though - right now, Priest Viotin was sailing back from the Town of Giran, his pockets filled to the brim with all kinds of candy and sweets! That was why Lanya lay there on the grassy hillside, finding shapes in the milky white clouds: she was waiting impatiently for the priest's boat to dock.<br><br>

Oh, candy! Lanya loved candy. She liked many things; animals, dancing, singing and skipping; but she loved candy. The very word would send her mind tumbling into empires of sugar and chocolate, armies of marshmallows and sherbet. Today was no different. <br>

Lanya stared at the sea and watched in awed silence as the dark sand turned into ripples of caramel and fudge. <br>
She shook herself back to reality, only to look up and begin morphing the white clouds in reams of candyfloss when....<br>
BOOM! BOOOOOOOOOM!! <br>
What was that?! An earthquake? Lanya felt the earth slip and tilt, saw the ocean churn white, and in the distance, great waves cresting.  She watched with wide eyes as a single huge wave formed and began rushing towards the land.  A scream crested on her own lips as a burning bright red light shot up into the sky.  <br><br>

Lanya ran, finally finding refuge under a fallen tree.  Great torrents of water rained down around her and flung the contents of the sea onto the land. <br>
 <br>
Lanya looked over the dead bark of her refuge and saw the tsunami wave growing bigger and closer. She couldn't swim, and she was too close to the water. She ran towards town, her little legs carrying her fast towards home... but not fast enough. <br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
The tsunami hit land, and though much of its force was spent on the fragile beach, watery fingers reached deeper towards the village.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
They soon grasped the young girl, who could do little but scream as she was taken by the wave, and slammed into a wall. Suddenly she was underwater, clawing at the blurry shapes before her. She couldn't swim. Lanya didn't want to die. She screamed underwater. Bubbles sprang from her mouth and rose to freedom, but she couldn't follow them, and her arms windmilled hopelessly as the swirling waves tossed her around. She held her breath and closed her eyes, wishing, willing this to all be a dream. She wanted to wake up in her mother's warm arms and cry her little eyes out, then tell her all about the horrible nightmare she'd had. She wanted to play with her friends and cuddle her dad and go to school and learn and to grow up and... and... she didn't want to die.... <br>
Something happened. Something touched her, but didn't touch her. Something moved her, lifted her. Shapes danced in the lights above. She felt warm, she felt her fading body being lifted. Colors faded, white light was everywhere. Silence, for a second, then rushing water, and... a woman's voice? <br>
"Are you alright?" She looked again, blinking until shapes gained definition. There were two figures above her. One was holding her, lifting her from what would have been her watery grave in a few more seconds. The woman spoke again, her voice soft and calm. "Hello, Lanya. I am Orodriel. You're from the Temple of Einhasad, aren't you?" Lanya blinked again, forcing more definition into the figures above her.<br>
Wait... was that... Iken?!<br><br>

Lanya knew of Iken. He had been raised by his aunt after his parents died during the war but he was always wandering by himself outside the town. They had never spoken before, in fact she had never seen any of the children speak to him. But there he was, saving her life.<br>

Orodriel spoke again. "Fortunately, we were able to cast the Eva's Kiss and stop you drowning just in the nick of time. You're not hurt, are you?" Lanya paused. She didn't even know. She moved her limbs, and aside from a bruised side, she seemed fine. She shook her  head, too scared to speak. <br>
Orodriel smiled, reaching down to push Lanya's hair from her eyes. She went to speak, when it happened again.<br><br>

BOOOOOOOOOOM!!! The ruby light shot up from the sea again, but as a flash this time. <br><br>

The water began to pull itself back towards the sea, taking Orodriel, Iken and Lanya with it. <br><br>

"Hold on!" The three were pulled into a massive whirlpool. It dragged them around, pulling them ever closer towards the core of the vortex. Then they saw it. A door shining in red at the bottom of the whirlpool.... <br><br><br>
