<br> <br> <font color="LEVEL">Saga Chapter #7 Battle</font> <br><br>They attacked before we were ready. Something had lured them in, likes wolves to the death cries of a wounded deer. They were ferocious, unforgiving, unrelenting. Taman Zu Rapatui's sword ripped two lizardmen in half, but still one broke through, ravaging his back with razor claws and snapping jaws. The Kamael's sword burst through the beast's torso. Taman was pulled back up, the defenses were restored.<br>"Harpies!" Kaurin was overwhelmed even before she had been able to warn the others. Her helmet was ripped from her head and her face spilled blood from a fresh, deep wound. She collapsed.<br><br>"Battle Heal!" Cried out Lanya, her hands summoning pure energy.<br><br>Meanwhile, Gnosian stood perfectly still in the very heart of the calamity, his silent incantations not nearly as big a threat to the creatures as the swinging swords and thrusting daggers. Or so they thought.<br>"Flame Strike!!" His eyes turned scarlet red, and as he raised his hands, huge fireballs erupted from the ground, engulfing the Harpies above.<br><br>"Iken! Be careful!" Orodriel shielded Iken, saving him from the whipping tail of a giant Basilisk. The magic flickered though, and the Basilisk attacked again. Poor Iken felt no pain, but could only watch in horror as his right arm was caught in the jaws of the cruel beast.<br>"Aargh!" Meruril's huge hammer through the Basilisk's head, killing it instantly.<br>.<br>.<br>The battle rage for hour after hour, but the monsters kept coming. Lanya and Orodriel were slumped on the ground, gasping for air. Their power was exhausted. Heintz's short stature prevented him from seeing beyond the first wave of monsters, so he could not see how many more were left. It was a seemingly endless number that drained their spirits just as fast as their exertions drained their energy. Hundreds of the Lord's warriors, men who had joined the travellers, had already been slain, while hundreds more lay dying, their calls for mercy ringing in the ears of those left alive.<br><br>Something screamed out in the distance, a huge, collosal roar that silenced the battle cries, and grabbed everyone's attention. It was the townspeople. The ordinary townspeople had come to fight against the monsters with their farming tools!<br><br>"C'mon lads! One more push!" Heintz waved the others on then threw himself at the monsters.<br>.<br>.<br>"Krrrracccck!" The last monster's scream. The blood-covered battlefield was finally silent. Hundreds of unrecognizable and mutilated bodies covered the ground. Poor Lanya had never seen such carnage, but carried on fighting, knowing that the villagers needed her skills. After the battle though, after the last beast had been destroyed, she fell. Orodriel held her, whispering words of comfort and encouragement as she wept into the copper dust.<br><br>"The red stones...." Gnosian reached down to one of the slain beasts, and as he pulled back up, one of the strange stones lay in his hand.<br>"They'll... they'll take us back? To Aden?" Iken crawled to his feet, holding one in his hand and examining it intently.<br>"Perhaps.... I'll have to... wait. What's that?" Gnosian squinted against the rising sun. Something was approaching, a dark blot in the sky. It was huge. It was Meruril who identified it.<br><br>"Nacondas... Dragon...!" Nacondas was a creature that she had only heard about from travelers when she ran a store in Giran Castle Town. A huge, demonic beast that thirsted for battle like no other. But the townspeople had no fight left in them. They were exhausted, hurt, done, and the only ones left alive. Gnosian thought hard. There had to be a way. There had to be something... yes! That's it!<br><br>"Quick! Gather the red stones!!" The others didn't know what to do, but once he gave the order, they started gathering.<br><br>"We have them all!" The dozen stones were placed together, and immediately started resonating with each other as their strong magic overflowed. The party gathered around the stones, watching the huge creature with one eye and anxiously waiting for Gnosian to do something.<br>.<br>.<br>"Come here, Nacondas!" Gnosian shouted at the huge beast, waving his arms about. What was he doing?! The beast roared, beating its wings faster. Gnosian waited, holding his arm out to the rest of the party. Waiting... waiting....<br><br>"NOW! Orodriel!" Gnosian and Orodriel poured their last powers into the piled up stones. They began to shine brightly, trembling with a high-pitched sound that ripped through the air.<br><br>The stones flashed. They were gone.<br><br><font color="LEVEL">The End (Please wait for the next chapter.)</font><br><br><br>
