<br> <br> <font color="LEVEL">Saga Chapter #4 Run Rabbit Run</font> <br><br>"Dwarves weren't built to run like this," thought Heintz, but run he did. He stopped for a moment, looked back, and wiped the sweat off his brow. <br><br>"Ach, they'll nae follow me all the way here... huff... huff.... No meal's worth that much effort eh?"<br><br>"Hisssssss!"<br><br>It was those infernal lizardmen, their primal calls emanating from somewhere just behind the treeline. <br><br>"Huff... huff.... Followed me here, have ye?!" Heintz said, leaning against a tree and gasping for air. Five, six scaly faces appeared over the bushes. They were watching, just watching, when a voice called out.<br><br>"Do you need help?" The voice had the timbre and the growl of a large male Orc. Heintz's reply was fast, even rushed.<br><br>"Aye! Huff huff... There... Lizardmen!" The Orc stepped forth--his frame was huge and the sword in his hand looked more like a dagger-- and charged the Lizardmen. <br><br>The forest cried out with the sounds battle cries and shattering bone. The lizardmen had numbers, but still nothing could match this Orc's abilities. Their hisses soon died down, leaving little but the passing breeze whistling through angled branches and lush canopy.<br><br>Heintz approached the Orc, his scarred face now spattered in blood.<br>"Thank ye, thank ye for your help! I'd have fought if I had a weaopn, but..."<br>The Orc cut him off. "It's nothing. Now... you aren't from Aden are you?"<br>"Aye, I am. See, two days ago, I found something... a stone. When I picked it up, it... it flashed, and all of a sudden... I was here."<br>"Red stone?"<br>"Aye... this is it." Heintz reached in his pocket and pulled out the stone. The orc looked on as the rock caught... trapped... his attention. It shimmered, squirmed under his gaze, enticing him forward, calling him. Just... one touch.<br>"I've... never seen anything like this before," said the Orc as he held the stone in his bloodied hands, the stone warm and shifting in his grip like a contented cat. Heintz paused, eyeing the Orc, eyeing the stone.<br>"Aye... I've seen my share of minerals, but never anything like this. Strange eh?! I uh... Oh! I am Heintz! Pleasure's mine!" He held out a thick hand.<br>"I am Taman Zu Rapatui." A moment passed before the Orc finally pried his gaze from the rock. He shook himself, handing it back quickly.<br>.<br>.<br>Later they cleaned themselves in the nearby creek before travelling to the house where Taman Zu Rapatui was staying. The humans who had helped Taman Zu Rapatui were artisan swordsmiths, so natutally Heintz was happy to meet them. They drank the night away with talk of swords and tales of adventure and legends.<br><br>The next morning the artisans told Heintz and Taman Zu to see the nearby Lord for more information on their strange stone. They prepared their belongings, said their farewells, then set off in the direction given to them by the artisans. <br><br><br><font color="LEVEL">Continued in the Meruril character card</font><br><br><br>
