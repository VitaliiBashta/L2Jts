It is forbidden among other races. They do not understand darkness and fear it, so therefore they exclude it. However, if there is light, there is shadow, and we can control the true power of black magic because we confront darkness with no fear.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/default/tetrarch_vellior002.htm">Ask about black magic</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
