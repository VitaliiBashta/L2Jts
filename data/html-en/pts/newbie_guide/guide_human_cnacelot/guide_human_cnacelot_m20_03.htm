Newbie Guide:<br>At your level, you can hunt anywhere on this island. The spider would probably be the best quarry. There are many spiders living along the road that begins at the northern mountain and runs south close to the shore line.<br>If you want to try a more difficult location, visit the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font> in the west; entry there was strictly regulated until quite recently. It is a dangerous place, but a strong party of adventurers can achieve great success there.<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_human_cnacelot/guide_human_cnacelot_m20.htm"><br>Go back.</a></body></html>
