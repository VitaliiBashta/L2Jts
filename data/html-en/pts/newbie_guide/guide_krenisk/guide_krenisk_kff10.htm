Newbie Guide:<br>Ah! You have matured a great deal since you last visited me. I am glad to see the change in you. I do not know if I can be of much help to you now, but feel free to ask. <br>If you already know the answer I give, come back to me after you reach level 11. At that time I will be able to give you new information. <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kff10_01.htm">"What do I have to do now?"</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kff10_02.htm">"Which equipment is suitable for me?"</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kff10_03.htm">"Tell the most suitable hunting site for me."</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kff10_04.htm">"Tell me about skils."</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kff10_05.htm">"Is there any available quest for me?"</a></body></html>
