Newbie Guide:<br>The <font color="LEVEL">One-Handed Sword</font> is the most basic weapon in the game, possessing balanced attributes. The Squire's Sword you began your adventures with was one of these. Unless you prefer a specific weapon, I recommend staying with a One-Handed Sword.<br>You can also use <font color="LEVEL">Fallen Attack</font> with it, which will allow you to strike a critical blow to enemies. <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kff10_021.htm">Back.</a></body></html>
