Newbie Guide:<br>Have you ever seen an item called a <font color="LEVEL">Soulshot</font> while hunting? <br>You know the Dwarves, right? A Soulshot is a type of <font color="LEVEL">bullet</font> devised by the most skilled Dwarven Artisans. It allows you to inflict greater damage, but unfortunately it disappears once used. <br>You will be able to acquire Soulshot-using weapons once you reach level 15. A Soulshot rated better than x1 will increase damage for the number of shots indicated. Check for the instructions when you buy weapons. <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kff20_02.htm">Back.</a></body></html>
