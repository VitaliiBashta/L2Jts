Newbie Guide:<br>At this level, if you prefer to use a specific attack skill, train hard to enhance that skill. Upgrade the ones you already use most when you become level 10. <br>As a rule, novices acquire an attack skill first and only later learn support skills. Therefore, it may be helpful to learn passive skills like <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Armor Mastery</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Magic Immunity</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Soul Mastery</font>. I also recommend that you learn <font color="LEVEL">Increased Power</font>, which temporarily enhances your attack power. <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kmf10.htm">Back.</a></body></html>
