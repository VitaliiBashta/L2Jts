Newbie Guide:<br>You must transfer your class at level 20. If you don't, there is nothing more that you can be taught and no new skills that you can learn.<br>If you choose to transfer to a Trooper, you may learn unique skills only known to Troopers. For example, if you use an Ancient Sword, you can learn <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Sword Mastery</font>, which will raise your attack power when using a Rapier, or <font color="LEVEL">Dark Strike</font>, which strikes enemies with a Sword, Ancient Sword, or Blunt Weapon.<br>How do those sound to you? Now, continue your training and complete your class transfer. Only then you will get what you desire!<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kmf20.htm">Back.</a></body></html>
