Newbie Guide:<br>You may not feel that you have grown, but I can see it plainly. <br>I am very proud of you! Now, let's talk about something a little different: <font color="LEVEL">how to live with other people</font>. <br>This is a transition period for you. Until you reach level 10, masters lead you, just as your parents did when you were younger. But from level 11 onwards, you will be taught only specific skills from the masters. You will have to experience more and put in much more effort to achieve the next level. <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kmf15_01.htm">"What do I have to do now?"</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kmf15_02.htm">"Which equipment is suitable for me?"</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kmf15_03.htm">"What is the most suitable hunting site for me?"</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kmf15_04.htm">"Tell me about skills."</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kmf15_05.htm">"Is there any available quest for me?"</a></body></html>
