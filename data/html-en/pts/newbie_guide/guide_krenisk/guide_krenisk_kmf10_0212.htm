Newbie Guide:<br>A <font color="LEVEL">One-Handed Blunt Weapon</font> has a higher accuracy than other weapons, but a low Critical Rate. Blunt Weapons are designed to <font color="LEVEL">reliably cause a lot of damage</font>. I recommend them for hunters, for example. <br>As you advance, you can acquire skills specifically for Blunt Weapons. Something to keep in mind about these weapons is that they have greater damage range than other weapon types. They may not be particularly attractive, but they are sturdy, reliable weapons.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kmf10_021.htm">Back.</a></body></html>
