Newbie Guide:<br>At your current level, a <font color="LEVEL">Wooden Breastplate</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Hard Leather Pants Set</font> would make an effective combination. You should seek Leather Shoes, a Wooden Helmet and Gloves to complete your set.<br>You cannot be fully equipped with those items because you are only at level 11, but if you buy them gradually you can be fully equipped as soon as you reach level 15. It might also be a wise investment to start saving now in order to purchase a Bone Breastplate at level 14 or 15.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kmf15_02.htm">Back.</a></body></html>
