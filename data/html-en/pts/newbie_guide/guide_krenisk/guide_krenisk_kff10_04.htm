Newbie Guide:<br>At this level, if you have a preferred  attack skill, train hard to develop it. Upgrade the ones you already use most when you reach Level 10. <br>You usually learn support skills after acquiring attack skills, so now is the time to learn skills such as  <font color="LEVEL">Armor Mastery</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Magic Immunity</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Soul Mastery</font>. If you already learned those, it would be advisable to acquire <font color="LEVEL">Rapid Attack</font>, which temporarily increases your attack speed. <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/newbie_guide/guide_krenisk/guide_krenisk_kff10.htm">Back.</a></body></html>
