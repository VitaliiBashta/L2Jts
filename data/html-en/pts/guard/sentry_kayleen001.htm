Sentry Kayleen:<br>Greetings. Have you seen many places? My wish is to adventure in the wide, outside world someday. When I give up my job as sentry, I am thinking of traveling to Elmore. If you go there, there is the village of <font color="LEVEL">Pabell</font> built by Dark Elves.<br>Maybe it's just because of the oppressive atmosphere that hangs around the <font color="LEVEL">School of Dark Arts</font>, but sometimes my wish seems a very remote possibility.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/guard/sentry_kayleen003.htm">Ask about Pabell of Elmore.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/guard/sentry_kayleen002.htm">Ask about the School of Dark Arts.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
