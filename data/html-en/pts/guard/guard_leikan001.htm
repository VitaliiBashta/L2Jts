Guard Leikan:<br>If you follow this road northeast, you will come to the Ruins of Agony. Originally, it was the village of Bernice, where I was born, but it was reduced to ashes by the war. If you see its ghastly state, you will understand why it's now called the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony.</font><br>If you pass the ruins and continue north, you will arrive at the <font color="LEVEL">forest where the Dark Elves live</font>. Although I've never gone there myself... Travelers say that it is dark and eerie in a very unnatural way. <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/guard/guard_leikan002.htm">Ask about the 'Ruins of Agony'.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/guard/guard_leikan003.htm">Ask about the Dark Forest.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
