Captain Gilbert:<br>Nice to meet you, young friend. I am Captain Gilbert. Our guards maintain the peace in the village and work day and night to protect the residents from ferocious beasts or orcs, just like the <font color="LEVEL">lighthouse</font> works constantly to protect ships from the rocks.<br>If you are planning to leave the village, ask the guards about getting around on the island. We wouldn't want you to suffer misfortune, lost in a forest full of orcs and wolves.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/guard/gilbert002.htm">Ask about the lighthouse.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
