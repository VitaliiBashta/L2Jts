<html><head><body>Guard Praga:<br>Gludin is a large port village on the southwest coast. Ships to Talking Island depart from there regularly.<br>If you want to go to the village of Gludin, take this road west until you come to a fork in the road, then take the road that goes southwest. You have to pass the Abandoned Camp, where Ol Mahum deserters are encamped, so be particularly careful.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/guard/guard_praga001.htm">Return</a></body></html>
