Sentinel Gartrandell:<br>May the blessing of the starlight fall upon you. My name is Gartrandell, one of the sentinels who guard the forest and the Mother Tree Glade.

I am also pleased that I can stay a little closer to my sweetheart.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/guard/sentinel_gartrandell002.htm">Ask about the Sanctum of Eva..</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
