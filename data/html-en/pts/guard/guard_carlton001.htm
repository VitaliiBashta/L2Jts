Guard Carlton:<br>The marsh to the north of Aden Castle is known as the Blazing Swamp. It sounds like  a hellish sea of fire covered in molten rock, but looking at it from the outside, its not much different than any other marsh. However, Pa'agrio did some mischief there and its inhabitants are quite peculiar.  They are all masters of the magic of fire. King Raoul ordered a waterway to be dug at the edge of the marsh to prevent the spread of fires to the surrounding areas. But the most interesting thing that ever happened in the Blazing Swamp was when King Amadeo was attacked there by Elmore... Oh well, that's a long story...<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/guard/guard_carlton002.htm">"What about the inhabitants of the Blazing Swamp?"</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
