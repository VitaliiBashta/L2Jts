Guard Aldis:<br>Baium, a king of the Elmoreden Empire, aspired to reach the world of the gods and to ultimately become a god himself. Shortly after becoming king he completely lost his mind, causing great suffering to many people...  He foolishly started  building that tower to reach the world of the gods.  The gods were not amused, wrecking the tower and confining the king there forever. But... No, no... never mind... Anyway, the tower came to be known as the Tower of Insolence due to the arrogance of the king.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/guard/guard_aldis003.htm">"Please tell me more details."</a></body></html>
