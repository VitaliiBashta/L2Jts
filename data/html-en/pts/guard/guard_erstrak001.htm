Guard Erstack:<br>Brrr! It's freezing out here! Nothing like a mug of Kofporch to thicken the blood on a day like this. What? You've never heard of Kofporch? Where've you been, kiddo? Were you born yesterday? <br>Kofporch is only brewed in a few areas in Schuttgart Territory. The best kinds are then hauled out and left to age in either the <font color="LEVEL">Den of Evil</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">Crypts of Disgrace</font>.  Dangerous?  Sure!
