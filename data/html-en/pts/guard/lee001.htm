Guard Leon:<br>Welcome to the Talking Island Village! I am Leon, one of the guards here. Our duty is to protect the village from the invasion of Orcs or werewolves and punish those who violate the laws of this kingdom.<br>Those who harm others are dealt with severely according to the orders of the king. You may think it is merciless, but I think that those who injure others deserve the same. <br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
