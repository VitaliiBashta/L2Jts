<html><head><body>Guard Rodic:<BR>Well, I have no personal knowledge of it but I can tell 
you what I've heard... <BR>It is said that Eva, the Goddess of Water, has a 
palace deep beneath the waves. It is surrounded by an inpenetrable garden, 
designed to repel invaders... The guards have searched for the entrance to her 
palace for years without success. Perhaps they have been looking in the wrong 
place... Maybe the entrance is underwater? At least that seems to be where they 
have been concentrating their search lately. I hope they don't ask us to help 
them!<BR><A action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/guard/guard_rodic001.htm">Return</A> </BODY></HTML>
