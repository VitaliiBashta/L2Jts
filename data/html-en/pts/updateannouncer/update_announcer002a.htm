<html><head><body>News Informer:<br>Next is a word from Priest Wood of Einhasad Temple in Aden.<br>"We have a new mission for adventurers who have helped with the Seven Signs missions in the past. If you are <font color="LEVEL"> level 81 or above</font>, I've got intel suggesting that the Revolutionaries of Dusk are beginning to investigate the Seals of the Seven Signs. But so too are the Rulers of Dawn renewing their interest in the seals. And as such we ask that any adventurers who have successfully completed missions in the past to come forward and help once again. This will be a difficult task, but the rewards will be more than worth your time. I implore you to come visit me today so we can start you on your journey." <br><br>(You must have completed the epic Seven Signs quest series.)<br><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-7801&reply=10">Teleport to Priest Wood (Aden)</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link pts/updateannouncer/update_announcer001.htm">Return to Main Menu</a></body></html>
