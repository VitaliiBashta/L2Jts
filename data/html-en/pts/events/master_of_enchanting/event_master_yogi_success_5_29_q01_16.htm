<html><head><body>Master Yogi:<br><font color="LEVEL">Congratulations on attaining the ultimate reward!</font> You are a true warrior of L2! <br>You are the first on the server -- and the first in the history of Lineage 2 -- to accompish this. Truly admirable!<br>Would you care to accompany me back to the mountains? With your luck and abilities, you're more than qualified to become my disciple. Ha ha ha ha! Ho ho... Well, now that I think about it, my house is too small. Perhaps some other time... <font color="LEVEL">Now go and tell the world of your great feat! Congratulations!</font><br>One final thing: there is no more additional reward, so it's useless to try to enchant again.</body></html>
