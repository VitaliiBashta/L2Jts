<html><head><body>Master Yogi:<br>Well done! Congratulations on reaching +22.<br> You are truly a great hero. If you succeed once more, you will have conquered everything. You will become the first on the server, perhaps even the first -- and last -- person during the entire event, to do so. It is a weighty decision for you to make. But whatever you decide, I applaud your efforts in getting this far.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=3000&reply=1">"This is enough.
