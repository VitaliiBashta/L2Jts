Nevit's Voice is an item that increases the amount of Recommendations you can give to others by 10.<br>
The 20 hour donation timer starts from the time of your last donation.<br>
In addition, this waiting time is shared by all characters on an account. Meaning that if you donate with one character that all characters will have to wait the 20 hours.<br>
However, there is no usage waiting time. Meaning you can use as many as you wish at the same time.
