Einhasad Temple is currently accepting donations for the needy and downtrodden. Those who wish to donate the minimum amount will receive a small token of appreciation that will provide 10 additional Recommendations for you to bestow on others.<br>
Should you feel more generous and decide to make a more sizable donation, you will receive Nevit's Hourglass which extends the length of your Hunting Bonus timer by 1 hour.<br>
Please show your support for those less fortunate than yourself and give today. Oh, and please take note that you can only donate every 20 hours.<br><br>
