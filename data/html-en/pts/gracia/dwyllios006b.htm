We are currently occupying both the Seed of Immortality and the Hall of Erosion. If you enter the Seed of Immortality, it will be possible to attack the Heart of Immortality.<br>
If you enter the Heart of Immortality, you can challenge Ekimus. He is continuously supplied with soul energy from the nearby tumors of death, however, making it impossible to defeat him as long as they exist. But if you destroy all them first, he will be vulnerable.<br>
The best strategy I can suggest is to gradually weaken him by having one party move through the area destroying the tumors of death while several other parties keep him occupied. <br>
You should also know that Ekimus cannot be killed. He can, however, fall into a deep trance if all his power becomes exhausted. If that happens, the entire Seed of Immortality will be free from his influence. That is why it is so important to prevent his power from spreading.<br>
Ah, one more thing. Ekimus has 2 magic dogs. Apparently they spread some irreparable energy of death. Once inside the Seed, you can obtain an item that might be useful in defending yourself from them. You'll learn more as you go.<br>
