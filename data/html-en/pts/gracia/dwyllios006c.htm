Currently we control the Seed of Infinity. <br>
We can enter and extract the seed energy from all areas. I have heard that undead ancient Gracians who have regained their wills sometimes wander about inside of the seed, so it's best to be on guard at all times.<br>
And know that as Ekimus slowly regains his power, the undead will begin to awaken in greater numbers.<br>
