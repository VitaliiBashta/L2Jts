Our Keucereus clan currently controls the Seed of Destruction.<br>
Whoever enters it can freely wander throughout its interior. If you wish to battle some of the enemy remnants, see Officer Edric at the entrance and gather the mysterious energy released from several gaps.<br>
Remember that the Mounted Troop has not completely withdrawn! They may attack at any time. Our scouts will raise the alarm if they see any evidence of one. If that occurs, enter the Seed of Destruction and prepare to defend the Seed.<br>
If you are caught outside, the Mounted Troop will surround the Seed and prevent us from re-entering. If that happens, all we can do is to pray that our comrades inside the Seed will be able to protect it...<br>
